  <title>Use Scraps, Sew Blocks, Make 100 Quilts - Stuart Hillard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use Scraps, Sew Blocks, Make 100 Quilts&lt;/em&gt; is the new book from the Sewing Bee’s quilting supremo Stuart Hillard. Featuring 100 block patterns and 100 fabulous quilt designs, this book enables readers to sew a fantastic collection of scrap quilts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every block featured comes with a breakdown of the fabric scraps required, assembly instructions and a detailed illustration of the finished block. Each of the 100 blocks can be used to make one of Stuart’s quilt designs – all the designs are brought to life by a detailed illustration, with 12 of Stuart’s absolute favourites captured in inspiring lifestyle photographs. Alternatively, any of the block patterns can be adapted and combined by quilters; they can personalise treatments, colours and arrangements, add extra borders, wider sashings and more, to design and sew their own unique quilts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside the block patterns and quilt designs, Stuart has drawn on years of teaching experience to include the ultimate quilting hacks, tips and tricks, as well as his ‘rules’ for successful scrap quilting. Plus, all the major techniques are explained with the help of step-by-step photographs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is perfect for beginners attempting their first quilt, and experienced quilters looking for new inspiration. Stuart’s designs and irresistible enthusiasm will encourage anyone to stop hoarding their scraps and start using up their stash!&lt;/p&gt;" />
