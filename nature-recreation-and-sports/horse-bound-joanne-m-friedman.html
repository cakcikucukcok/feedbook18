  <title>Horse Bound - Joanne M. Friedman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life with horses is challenging, exciting, and always funny when viewed through the eyes of a lifelong horse lover. In &lt;i&gt;Horse Bound&lt;/i&gt;, Gallant Hope Farm owner Joanne Friedman invites you to empathize, sympathize, and laugh along as she chronicles the antics of her horses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman shares an entertaining glimpse into a world where horses are her addiction, her sanity, and her source of humor. As she traces the exploits of the horses of her farm and provides time-tested advice based on research and personal experience, she vividly illustrates how she and the horses have learned to coexist and communicate with each other. Through her essays, Friedman recalls the mystery of Mommy Ears, the joy and pain of recognition as time changes how the world transforms the barn and fields, and the myriad of emotions she felt as both her beloved big paint gelding, Zip, and the herd became acclimated to life on the farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This collection of essays continues the story of a seasoned horse lovers unforgettable experiences as she comes to realize that being horse bound is her most valuable affliction.&lt;/p&gt;" />
