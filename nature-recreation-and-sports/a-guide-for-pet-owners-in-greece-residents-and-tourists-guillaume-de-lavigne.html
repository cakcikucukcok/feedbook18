  <title>A Guide for Pet Owners in Greece - Residents and Tourists - Guillaume de Lavigne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This guide is intended for all pet-owners living or planning to live in Greece, as well as for all the tourists wishing to adopt a pet during their holidays. Many foreigners living in Greece have rescued and adopted a dog or a cat. Foreigners planning to come to live in Greece with their pet want to know precisely how to travel safely and how to respect the Greek law. The same questions cross the mind of those tourists wanting to adopt a pet and take it with them to their homeland. They have their heart set on doing everything that&#39;s necessary to provide their pet with the compulsory papers, veterinary care, disease-prevention methods, shelter and to comply with the law.There is too much false or unreliable advice scattered around on internet-forums or conveyed among people. That&#39;s why the goal of this book is to discuss each of these topics and much more in-depth. It gives each one of you, concerned with your pet&#39;s welfare, dog or cat, an answer to your queries." />
