  <title>Coach &#39;Em Up - Caz McCaslin, Matt Litton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There are two types of coaches in American sports: the ones who think, What can my players do for me? and those who approach the craft with the mindset of What can I do for my players?.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter where games are played - from neighborhood courts to domed stadium fields; local recreational leagues to the Big Leagues - sports have become broken. Parents fighting on the sidelines, players punching referees, coaches berating youth-age players, abuse of players in the college ranks, and all for what?
