  <title>Barle&#39;s Story: One Polar Bear&#39;s Amazing Recovery from Life as a Circus Act - Else Poulsen, Gay Bradshaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;When a 19-year old female polar bear named Barle is rescued from the inhumane conditions of a circus in the Caribbean and flown to safety in Detroit, zookeeper Else Poulsen &amp;#151; renowned throughout the world for her work rehabilitating bears who have been abused &amp;#151; is on hand to meet her and help her on the road to recovery and self-discovery. Thus begins Barle&amp;#8217;s gradual introduction into the world of polar bears. Slowly she forges relationships with the other bears in the zoo and eventually mates with a young male and successfully raises a cub. By living in a caring, enriched environment focused on her welfare, Barle is able to recover from the trauma she had suffered at the circus and develop skills that are important to thriving as a polar bear. As Poulsen documents, however, not all captive bears are so fortunate. Augmented with black-and-white photographs, &lt;I&gt;Barle&amp;#8217;s Story&lt;/I&gt; provides a rich and moving portrait of a remarkable bear and of the author&amp;#8217;s inspiring work to help her discover her true polar bear ways.&lt;/div&gt;" />
