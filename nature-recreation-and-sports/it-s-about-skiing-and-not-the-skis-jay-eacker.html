  <title>It’S About Skiing and Not the Skis - Jay Eacker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="People have been skiingand no doubt teaching others to do the samefor thousands of years. The earliest evidence for it is a picture on the wall of a cave in Norway that was drawn sometime around 4500 BC.
Skiing is something that we do. It is a behavior. Teaching others to ski is also something that we do. It, too, is a behavior.
Pavlov and his dog helped to demonstrate  that behavior is lawful and orderly. Various forms of conditioning as well as reinforcement, generalization, discrimination, punishment, and extinction change behavior. But why do we ski and teach others to do the same? These behaviors can also be accounted for, but no one has done ituntil now.
Develop a better understanding of why we ski and become a better skier or ski instructor in the process. Youll gain a greater appreciation of the sport once you discover &lt;i&gt;Its About Skiing and Not the Skis.&lt;/i&gt;" />
