  <title>Baseball&#39;s Roaring Twenties - Ronald T. Waldo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Following the 1919 Black Sox scandal, baseball needed men willing and able to pump life back into the game during tough times. Numerous ballplayers stepped forward and left their mark on the national pastime as it continued to thrive and grow during a decade that became known as the Roaring Twenties, a raucous, happy time period when a free-spirited nature prevailed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Baseball&amp;rsquo;s Roaring Twenties: A Decade of Legends, Characters, and Diamond Adventures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Ronald T. Waldo recounts the rollicking escapades surrounding a distinctive collection of players, managers, and umpires that truly personified this era of baseball history. Waldo includes a mix of unique stories and amusing tales surrounding baseball greats like Babe Ruth, Connie Mack, Rabbit Maranville, and Casey Stengel, alongside less famous diamond performers such as Duster Mails, Jay Kirke, Jimmy O&amp;rsquo;Connell, and Possum Whitted. The fans&amp;mdash;who were every bit as important in helping the game grow during the &amp;lsquo;20s&amp;mdash;are also given their due with a chapter of their own.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;From the story of Heinie Mueller unceremoniously pushing his attractive cousin out of sight when he saw manager Branch Rickey approaching to the tale of minor league hurler Augie Prudhomme literally following the sarcastic directive from pilot George Stallings to burn his uniform, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Baseball&amp;rsquo;s Roaring Twenties &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;provides an entertaining perspective of baseball during this singular decade. Amusing and informative, this book will be of interest to baseball fans and historians of all generations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
