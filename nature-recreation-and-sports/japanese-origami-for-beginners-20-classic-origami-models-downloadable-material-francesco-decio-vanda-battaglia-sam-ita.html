  <title>Japanese Origami for Beginners: 20 Classic Origami Models [Downloadable Material] - Francesco Decio, Vanda Battaglia, Sam Ita</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;Make simple and fun paper craft models with this easy origami ebook.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The ancient art of origami originated in Japan, where it is steeped in traditional values. The 20 models presented include many with strong symbolic meanings, such as the carp, the frog and the crane, which symbolize longevity, good luck and perseverance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also included are paper models which have practical uses, such as a bag in which to store spices or powdered medications, the masu box for containing small gifts, and uniquely shaped notes with elaborate closures. The more playful side of origami is represented as well: the stylized sumo wrestler with realistic moves has entertained Japanese children for centuries, and the paper Samurai hat is fun to play with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Origami is an ideal activity for children since paper folding develops dexterity and creativity. Origami is also a craft based on a few fundamental 3D folding techniques, so &lt;I&gt;Japanese Origami for Beginners&lt;/I&gt; is a useful starting point for fans of all ages and abilities.  Although this book is aimed at origami beginners, it contains projects suitable for origami fans of all ages and abilities and is the perfect book for all those who enjoy making things with their hands.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This book opens with an illustrated history of origami that highlights the masters and evolution of this pastime and art form up until the present day. A glossary of important origami folding symbols shows you how to follow the diagrams, which are commonly used to indicate how to fold origami models. Easy-to-follow step-by-step instructions follow for each of the 20 models. For those who prefer to see the models folded, it includes complete downloadable video instructions. None of the projects require paint or glue; so just grab origami paper and start folding right away!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
