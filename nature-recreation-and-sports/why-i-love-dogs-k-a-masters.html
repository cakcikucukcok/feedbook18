  <title>Why I Love Dogs - K. A. Masters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why I Love Dogs is about the love story between people and their beloved pets. It is meant to be a conversation piece for families, to help them share the entire cycle of joy, love, and loss that come when a family opens their hearts to a pet. This book brings up questions that I had when I loved and lost a pet but does not pretend to know all of the answers. It also gives a great sense of hope that the experience of sharing the love of a pet is more than worth the sorrow that happens when the pet passes on. There is some mystery regarding what happens when they leave us, but God has a purpose and plan for all of His beloved creation. He put them here for a reason, and His eye is on the sparrow. In many cases, the cycle of love continues as we open our hearts yet again to another pet. All of them are unique treasures and blessings in our lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
