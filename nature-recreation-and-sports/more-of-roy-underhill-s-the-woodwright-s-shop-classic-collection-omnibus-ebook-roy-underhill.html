  <title>More of Roy Underhill’s The Woodwright’s Shop Classic Collection, Omnibus Ebook - Roy Underhill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For more than twenty-five years, Roy Underhill has taught the techniques of traditional hand-tool woodworking. In six books and on his popular, long-running PBS series, &lt;i&gt;The Woodwright&#39;s Shop&lt;/i&gt;, America&#39;s leading authority on old-time woodcraft has inspired millions to take up chisel and plane. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new Omnibus Ebook brings together the final three books into another collection of Woodwright classics.  Designed for both woodworking novices and for more seasoned woodworkers looking for enjoyable projects, these books feature step-by-step instructions, complete with easy-to-follow photographs and measured drawings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this Omnibus Ebook edition:  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Woodwright&#39;s Apprentice&lt;br/&gt;Twenty Favorite Projects From &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Woodwright&#39;s Shop&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Woodwright&#39;s Apprentice&lt;/i&gt; begins with directions for building a workbench. Each successive project builds new skills for the apprentice woodworker--from frame construction to dovetailing, turning, steam-bending, and carving. Among the twenty items featured are an African chair, a telescoping music stand, a walking-stick chair, a fireplace bellows, and a revolving Windsor chair.  Designed both for woodworking novices and for more seasoned woodworkers looking for enjoyable projects, the book includes step-by-step directions, complete with easy-to-follow photographs and measured drawings, and an illustrated glossary of tools and terms. All of the pieces presented here are based on projects featured in past and upcoming seasons of &lt;i&gt;The Woodwright&#39;s Shop&lt;/i&gt; television show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Woodwright&#39;s Eclectic Workshop&lt;br/&gt;This book features step-by-step instructions for such popular projects as the Adirondack chair, tavern table, folding ladder, rocking horse, lathe, and kayak. All projects are illustrated with photographs and measured drawings.  The book also includes colorful descriptions of what it was like to be a tradesperson who made a living by hand, working with the tools and methods Roy describes on television and in his books: carpenters, joiners, wheelwright, millwrights, chairmakers, and blacksmiths. As Roy puts it, he wants to examine &#39;the old paths in the way that they were originally taken: not as adventuresome recreations but a profession that put food on the table and clothes on the kids.&#39;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Woodwright&#39;s Guide&lt;br/&gt;Working Wood with Wedge and Edge&lt;br/&gt;Roy shows how to engage the mysteries of the splitting wedge and the cutting edge to shape wood from forest to furniture. Beginning with the standing tree, each chapter of &lt;i&gt;The Woodwright&#39;s Guide&lt;/i&gt; explores one of nine trades of woodcraft: faller, countryman and cleaver, hewer, log-builder, sawyer, carpenter, joiner, turner, and cabinetmaker. Hundreds of detailed drawings by Eleanor Underhill (Roy&#39;s daughter) illustrate the hand tools and processes for shaping and joining wood. A special concluding section contains detailed plans for making your own foot-powered lathes, workbenches, shaving horses, and taps and dies for wooden screws.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
