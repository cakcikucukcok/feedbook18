  <title>The Burn Game - Bozo #2</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are several assumptions of how the sport of burning began. Many believe that it is a natural behavior pattern in the male human species dating back to, as early as, the caveman era. As a young man reaches his early stages of adulthood, he can often develop an overwhelming desire to compete in various social events and games. Although many may consider such games to be juvenile and decadent, it is also a belief of many that such games are a crucial element in the development of ones masculinity and social prowess.
	Never the less, young men over the years have become more and more precise in their attacks on peers in their attempts to ascend the ladder of manhood. The old saying boys will be boys, can be heard ever present in every school hallway, summer camps, military barrack, inmate housing unit, or sports locker room.
	In recent years, the Burn Game has become somewhat of an underground favorite among adolescents, as well as up-to-date elder males that strive to stay in touch with their more youthful counterparts, for establishing a sense of camaraderie amongst each other. The reason for this is suspected to be that the Burn Game requires no equipment, has no time limit, and literally requires no verbal communication. This means that the playing field is universal, and that the Burn Game can virtually be executed anywhere in the world.
	This book was written in hopes to enlighten those of less knowledge of the game and to help portray some insight why it has become such a popular pass-time of the male human species." />
