  <title>Reading Football - Michael Oriard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is football an athletic contest or a social event? Is it a game of skill, a test of manhood, or merely an organized brawl? Michael Oriard, a former professional player, asks these and other intriguing questions in &lt;i&gt;Reading Football&lt;/i&gt;, the first contemporary book about football&#39;s formative years.      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;American football began in the 1870s as a game to be played, not watched. Within a brief ten years, it had become a great public spectacle with an immense following, a phenomenon caused primarily by the voluminous commentary about the game conducted in popular newspapers and magazines.      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oriard shows how this constant narrative in football&#39;s early years developed many different stories about what the game &lt;i&gt;meant&lt;/i&gt;: football as pastime, as the sport of gentlemen, as a science, as a game of rules and their infringements. He shows how football became a series of cultural stories about power, luck, strategy, and deception. These different interpretations have been magnified by football&#39;s current omnipresence on television. According to Oriard, televised football now plays a cultural role of enormous importance for men, yet within the field of cultural studies the influence of football has been ignored until now.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the book:      &lt;br/&gt;&quot;A receiver sprints down the sideline, fast and graceful, then breaks toward the middle of the field where a safety waits for him. From forty yards upfield the quarterback releases the ball; it spirals in an elegant arc toward the goalposts as the receiver now for the first time looks back to pick up its flight. The pass is a little high; the receiver leaps, stretches, grasps the ball--barely, fingers clutching--at the very moment that the safety drives a helmet into his unprotected ribs. The force of the collision flings the receiver backward, slamming him to the turf. . . .   This familiar tableau, this exemplary moment in a football game, epitomizes the appeal of the sport: the dramatic confrontation of artistry with violence, both equally necessary.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
