&lt;div id=&quot;00N40000001lfG4_ileinner&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;We Are ALL Different &lt;/u&gt;combines my love of children and pets into a real-life look at bullying. I use my own animals, as well as those of friends, to explain to children just how much bullying hurts. Even something that seems harmless, like laughing at someones freckles, is portrayed as the real pain that is felt when my Dalmatian is shown hiding her face in embarrassment and hurt. Several of the animals in the book are having to deal with mean comments made by classmates. The overall message that is conveyed is that everyone is different, everyone is beautiful and everyone is worthy of being loved.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
