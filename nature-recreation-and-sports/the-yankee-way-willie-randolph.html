  <title>The Yankee Way - Willie Randolph</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Legendary New York Yankee Willie Randolph tells the story of his life playing and coaching for the most storied professional sports franchise in the world, detailing his career on and off the field with some of baseball biggest stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his long-awaited memoir, Willie Randolph shares stories from life in New York Yankee pinstripes, opening up about the team that raised him and the city that molded him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For over thirty years, Randolph has been a part of Yankee lore and mythology. From the best seat in the stadium he has witnessed the greats, from Reggie Jackson to Don Mattingly to Derek Jeter; larger-than-life managers, including Billy Martin and Joe Torre; and of course The Boss himself. Randolph offers truly unique, firsthand insight into some of the greatest players to ever play the game and the greatest teams ever to call the Bronx their home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But though Randolph is a Yankee, he is first and foremost a quintessential New Yorker. Brooklyn born and raised, he shares memories of his rise from the projects to the house that Ruth built. Along the way he discusses, his triumphs and struggles on the field and in the dugout, as well as his time spent as manager of the Yankees&amp;#8217; crosstown rivals, the Mets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As fascinating and thoughtful as Randolph himself, filled with sixteen pages of black-and-white photos, &lt;em&gt;The Yankee Way&lt;/em&gt; is a moving portrait of a legendary team, a unique city, and a remarkable man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;With 16 pages of black &amp;#38; white photos.&lt;/p&gt;" />
