  <title>Stewart Stanley: the Adventures of a Tiny German Dog - Melanie Stanley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Stewart StanleyThe Adventures of a Tiny German Dog is an amusing look at the daily struggle of Stewart Douglas Stanley, wirehaired dachshund extraordinaire.  No one knows exactly how Stewarts journey began.  He was sold on Craigs List and then was shelter bound when Mother saw him and melted after looking into his big brown eyes.  From that day forward, Stewart has been on a daily quest for chicken and recovered treasure from tipped trash cans.  His nemesis is Father (the one that refuses to share his chicken with this tiny wiry German).  Mother is the mediator in this struggle between dachshund and man.  She documents Stewarts life as he navigates his way through the Stanley household which includes his four very large brothers: Jack and Charlie (black Labrador mixes), Patch (an Australian Blue Heeler with three legs) and Dega (a black German Shepherd also known as Big Ears).  While Stewart is prone to mischief he will win your heart with his never ending narration of his eternal search for chicken. Stewart is more than just a dog.  Hes a compact version of who we all want to be.  He finds joy in the moment and loves with his whole heart" />
