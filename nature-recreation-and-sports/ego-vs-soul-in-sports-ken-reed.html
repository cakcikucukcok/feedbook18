  <title>Ego Vs. Soul in Sports - Ken Reed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Imagine. 
Imagine the world of sports without ego.
No more trashtalking, showboating, cheating, cheap shots, or running up the score. No more wackadoo parents and coaches ruining youth sports. No more prima donna athletes with an inflated view of their own importance.
The win-at-all-costs mentality? Gone. The me-first athlete? History. Greedy owners that put their wallets ahead of whats best for the game? Bye-bye.
As John Lennon once sang, Imagine . . .
Sports have always brought out the best and worst in people. One of the compelling aspects of sports is that character is openly on display. Problem is, the ugly side of sports is getting way too loud these days. The ego in sports has run amok. And as the ego takes center stage, win-at-all-costs (WAAC) and profit-at-all-costs (PAAC) mentalities and behaviors begin to dominate. Things like sportsmanship start to take a backseat.
Nevertheless, despite all the ego- and greed-based negativity in todays sports world, there are still some pearls out there, little stories in the back of the sports section that stir the soul. While too many sports center headlines bring forth feelings of shame, its the snippets about obscure athletes that bless us with shining examples of the human spirit and give us reason for hope. 
This is a book of short essays about sport at its best and sport at its worst. Hopefully, the book is somewhat entertaining and, occasionally, even enlightening. Ultimately, however, the books goal is to inspire those who love sports to find a way to make the sports world a better place to be. 
And that means a place with a lot less ego and a lot more soul.
Because in the big picture, it really is about how you play the game." />
