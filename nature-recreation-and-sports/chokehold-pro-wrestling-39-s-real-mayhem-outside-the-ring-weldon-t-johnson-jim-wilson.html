  <title>Chokehold: Pro Wrestling&#39;s Real Mayhem Outside the Ring - Weldon T. Johnson, Jim Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This meticulously crafted and searing critique of pro wrestling is unlike any wrestling book published: Chokehold is a penetrating description of pro wrestlings dark side, a secret underworld of deception, exploitation and greed. &lt;/p.
&lt;p&gt;		The storyteller is Big Jim Wilson, All-American football player and survivor of seven years in the NFL, who was promised wealth and the world championship as pro wrestler.  Instead, Jim Wilson found a surprisingly lucrative sports entertainment industry built on a pyramid of secrets that included abusive control of its performers and a long history of illegal business practices and corruption of politicians and state athletic commissions.  Chokehold describes and documents the abuses that Jim Wilson witnessed and endured  blacklisting, strong-arm tactics, homosexual blackmail, defiance of the U.S. Justice Department and bribery of TV executives and arena managers.  Chokehold is an explosive indictment of the pro wrestling industrys business practices as well as a thoughtful proposal for pro wrestlings reform.&lt;/p&gt;   
	&lt;p&gt;	This book is not a conventional expos of pro wrestlings orchestrated stunts, gimmicks and blade jobs.  Instead, it is an unprecedented examination of pro wrestlings less visible cons outside the ring -- its hidden manipulation of wrestlers with broken promises and broken bones and a backstage power of the pencil that writes scripts for wrestler stardom or extinction.  Chokehold describes a secret slice of the wrestling life where traveling troupes of heels and babyfaces understand how they got into the game, but cannot find a way up or out.  This is the story of why and how the big guys almost always lose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;		Chokehold is part autobiography and part pro wrestling history.   Written in wrestlespeak (the industrys insider argot), it is dedicated to the memory of the older boys whose broken bodies and shattered lives should have taught us something.   In addition to Jim Wilsons experiences in The Business, this book reviews significant but forgotten episodes in the wrestling industrys long history of gangland tactics.  The industrys infamous blacklist is revisited by revealing the dozens of wrestlers from the past whose names were on it.  The industrys history of predatory promotional wars in California, Georgia, Texas and Virginia is told with FBI reports obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.  From court documents, this book names compromised state athletic commissions, TV station managers and local politicians  from wrestlings viewpoint, the best that money could buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;		There are many famous wrestling names in this book --Gorgeous George, Lou Thesz, Jack Brisco, the Funk brothers, Dusty Rhodes, Bruiser Brody, Bill Watts and  others.  Another is The Sheik (Eddie Farhat), who says: There aint no nice guys in this business. There aint no people  theres dollars!   Another is Jim Wilsons tag team partner Thunderbolt Patterson who warned Jim, The wrestling business takes advantage of anybody who has any notoriety or ability.  You got to understand that wrestlers are worse than whores.  They are pimped.  They use you as long as they possibly can or as long as you dont complain.  When you complain, they get rid of you. &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Another is Jim Wilsons friend The Magnificent Zulu (Ron Pope) who summarizes his career this way:  Its such a crooked business.  The guys [wrestlers] are a bunch of crooks.  They steal from the marks and the promoters steal from them.  The guys [wrestlers] want to be stars!  Theyll do anything  theyll cut throats for it.  Actually, wrestlers dont have to be paid.  All they need is a couple of six packs of beer a night and a nice looking ring rat with a good body. Or, drugs and a ring rat.  Its not the money.  Its being a star!  Its the glory and the pussy! &lt;/p&gt;
