  <title>When Chicago Ruled Baseball - Bernard A. Weisberger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1906 the baseball world saw something that had never been done. Two teams from the same city squared off against each other in a World Series that pitted the heavily favored Cubs of the National League against the hardscrabble American League champion White Sox. Now, more than a century later, noted historian Bernard A. Weisberger tells the tale of a unique time in baseball, a unique time in America, and a time when Chicago was at the center of it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When Chicago Ruled Baseball&lt;/em&gt; brings to life a dazzling epoch in a land of the self-made man&amp;#8212;where A. G. Spalding helped establish baseball as both a national pastime and a thriving business, where Mordecai &amp;#8220;Three-Finger&amp;#8221; Brown overcame a horribly disfiguring injury and pitched his way into the Hall of Fame . . . and Tinkers-to-Evers-to-Chance proved that you could use teamwork to stand out as stars. Weisberger brings to life an unforgettable story of how a city that had rebuilt itself from the ashes of the Great Fire thirty-five years earlier became the focal point of an entire baseball-loving country, and one grand sporting contest staked its claim as one of the most remarkable and electrifying World Series ever to be played. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some images that appeared in the print edition of this book are unavailable in the electronic edition due to rights reasons.&lt;/p&gt;" />
