  <title>1536 Free Waters and Other Blackjack Endeavors - Glen Wiggy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Why is there a twelve on the cover of this blackjack book instead of the usual twenty-one? No blackjack author in their right mind would put a hand of twelve on the cover. Glen Wiggy didhe is full of surprises like that. Part how-to manual, part memoir, 1536 Free Waters and Other Blackjack EndeavorsFinding Profit and Humor in Card-Counting chronicles Wiggys amusing experiences while playing blackjack during more than eight hundred casino visits from January 2001 until June 2008. It also introduces blackjack card-counting in a fun and easy-to-learn format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the everyday casino patrons, starving puppies, angry pit bosses, French doughnuts, talking sea gulls, and 1536 bottled waters make unforgettable appearances in these entertaining stories tailored for casual blackjack gamblers.

&lt;p&gt; Aspects of blackjack basic strategy&lt;br /&gt; Fundamentals of card-counting&lt;br /&gt; Techniques for managing money&lt;br /&gt; Dangers of greedy gambling behavior&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike most blackjack strategy guides, 1536 Free Waters and Other Blackjack Endeavors wont teach you how to kill the dealer or make a living playing the game. Instead, youll learn basic strategy and introductory card-counting skills that give you enough confidence to approach the table with a positive attitude and reasonable expectation of winning. Plus, youll learn what to expect from the cards and the wonderfully strange people and places you may encounter. Enjoy the ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, the most enjoyable blackjack book Ive read in my twenty years as the editor of a gambling publishing company. It had me laughing out loud.&lt;br /&gt;Deke Castleman, editor for Huntington Press&lt;/p&gt;
