  <title>The Time-Crunched Cyclist, 2nd Ed.: Fit, Fast, Powerful in 6 Hours a Week - Chris Carmichael, Jim Rutberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Time-Crunched Cyclist&lt;/i&gt; reveals the fastest way to get fit for road racing, century rides, cyclocross, Gran Fondos, mountain bike events, and multi-day cycling tours. With elite cycling coach Chris Carmichael&#39;s innovative, time-saving approach, busy cyclists will develop fitness, speed, and power in just 6 hours a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through his popular endurance coaching service, Carmichael noticed that many busy cyclists are unable to make performance gains using conventional training methods; they simply don&#39;t have enough time to train. Carmichael Training Systems developed a new approach--the Time-Crunched Training Program--to help cyclists achieve competitive fitness and power without the impossible time demands of traditional training methods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Time-Crunched Cyclist&lt;/i&gt; shows cyclists how to build fitness on a realistic schedule by tapping the power of high-intensity interval (HIIT) workouts. Cyclists learn the science behind this alternative approach to training before performing the CTS field tests to get a baseline reading of their fitness. 8 comprehensive training plans include effective time-crunched workouts, nutrition guidelines, and strength training to develop the speed and endurance for a wide variety of cycling races and events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New programs for this second edition bring cyclists up to speed for cyclocross racing, mountain bike endurance rides, and show bicycle commuters how to turn their twice-a-day rides into effective time-crunched workouts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Time-Crunched Cyclist&lt;/i&gt; will help former racers, bicycle commuters, &#39;cross fans, and mountain bikers capture their best performance--all in the time they have right now.&lt;/p&gt;" />
