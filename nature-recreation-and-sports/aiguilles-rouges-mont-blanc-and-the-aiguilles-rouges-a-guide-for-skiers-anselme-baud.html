  <title>Aiguilles rouges - Mont Blanc and the Aiguilles Rouges - a Guide for Skiers - Anselme Baud</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Discover the skiing downhills of the Aiguilles rouges Mountain in this very detailed and documented book, written by one of the most talented skiers of his generation.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Located at the very heart of the highest mountains of Europe, the majestic Aiguilles rouges massif stands as a reference among the most sacred skiing places in the world. When winter comes, this snow-addict heaven offers a unique range of dream slopes, from the easiest to the most breathtakingly high ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anselme Baud is an extreme skiing leading head and one of the best experts of this mountain. From classic skiing hikes to mountaineering competitions, this guide book presents a precise description of all the biggest slopes this mythic area could offer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this volume you can find all the information about the Aiguilles rouges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks to his charming accounts and instructive advice, Anselme Baud shares with us his precious and wide experience as a high mountain guide and an exceptional skier.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Born in Morzine in 1948, Anselme Baud left his mark on the Alps skiing steep slopes history. As a high mountain guide in 1973, he was one the first to ski on extreme downhills in the Alps, the Andes, in Antarctica or in the Himalayas. As an ENSA professor, he supervised during several years the mountain guides trainings in Bolivia and Nepal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EXCERPT&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Aiguilles Rouges chain could have suffered from being so close to its illustrious neighbour, the Mont Blanc Massif, but in fact the huge variety of routes on offer here means that the two ranges complement each other. From easy tours to narrow couloirs, from routes with easy access from ski lifts to numerous possible traverses, the Aiguilles Rouges is an integral part of the Mont Blanc region. Thanks to this ease of access and the great circuits that can be done in this area, this is also the starting point for trips heading north: to Sixt, Flaine and Les Portes du Soleil; or to the east and Switzerland: to the high limestone Alps via the Col de la Tour Salière and the Barberine cols; not forgetting, of course, the great routes on the Bel Oiseau, the Dent de Fenestral or Fontanabran between Finhaut and Les Marécottes. Moreover, this chain of crystalline rock (gneiss) also offers superb views of the whole of the Mont Blanc Massif, which are both breathtakingly beautiful and, more importantly, are a great opportunity for getting a look at routes for the future. The other advantage the Aiguilles Rouges has is that you can easily choose the best side of the chain to ski on, as the ski lifts and the pistes are all on the south side and the best descents are to be had on the ‘wild’ north side where the snow stays in excellent condition for a long time. The secondary ranges of the Perrons and Luisin-Emaney don’t have ski lifts and usually get skied at the beginning of the season, for road access to the Emosson Dam, as the snow cover is general better here (the area is near the very wet valleys of Haut Faucigny)." />
