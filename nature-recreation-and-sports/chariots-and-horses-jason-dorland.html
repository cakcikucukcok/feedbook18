  <title>Chariots and Horses - Jason Dorland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jason Dorland is no stranger to competition. As a rower and coach, he’s seen his share of races won and lost. But after a devastating performance at the 1988 Olympics, Jason was overwhelmed by a sense of failure—and with small wonder. Winning at all costs, whereby the playing field is seen as a battlefield, is pretty much the industry standard when it comes to motivating elite athletes. That philosophy coloured his own coaching style, until he met someone who coped with the loss of her own Olympic dream, and viewed competition itself, in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An honest, intimate look at the reality of high-level athletics, &lt;i&gt;Chariots and Horses&lt;/i&gt; is more than a sports story. In charting his progress from struggling athlete to an inspirational coach driven to instill a healthy competitive spirit in his rowers, Jason Dorland shows how in sports and in life, it’s all about the journey.&lt;/p&gt;" />
