  <title>Bring Your &quot;A&quot; Game - Jennifer L. Etnier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mental training is just as important as physical training when it comes to success in sport. And like physical fitness, mental toughness is something that can be taught and learned. Yet many young athletes have not learned the psychological skills needed to develop their best game. This book was written specifically for young athletes interested in improving their performance and reaching their potential in sport. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bring Your &quot;A&quot; Game&lt;/i&gt; introduces key strategies for mental training, such as goal setting, pre-performance routines, confidence building, and imagery. Each of the seventeen chapters focuses on a single mental skill and offers key points and exercises designed to reinforce the concepts. The book encourages athletes to incorporate these mental skills into their daily lives and practice sessions so that they become second nature during competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether used at home by student athletes or assigned by coaches as part of team development, &lt;i&gt;Bring Your &quot;A&quot; Game&lt;/i&gt; will help young performers develop a plan for success and learn to deal with the challenges of pursuing excellence in sport.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
