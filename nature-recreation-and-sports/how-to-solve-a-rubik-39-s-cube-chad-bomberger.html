      <meta name="description" content="Solve a Rubik&amp;rsquo;s Cube and Impress Your Friends!&lt;br /&gt;
Inside How to Solve a Rubik&amp;rsquo;s Cube, you&amp;rsquo;ll discover simple, easy-to-understand instructions for wrapping your brain around this fascinating and intriguing puzzle. Even if you&amp;rsquo;re a complete beginner, you can easily solve one of the world&amp;rsquo;s top-ranked and most-beloved puzzles &amp;ndash; in the wink of an eye!&lt;br /&gt;
For over 4 decades, people have tested their minds against the Rubik&amp;rsquo;s cube &amp;ndash; invented by Erno Rubik, a Hungarian architect. Many impressive thinkers have worked with the cube, including names like Etter, Sbahi, Hays, and Thai. You can join the Rubik&amp;rsquo;s cube community (called &amp;ldquo;cubers&amp;rdquo;) and learn how to improve your mental skills, brain activity, and dexterity!&lt;br /&gt;
With this book, How to Solve a Rubik&amp;rsquo;s Cube, you can access a layer-by-layer solution to this classic puzzle:&lt;br /&gt;
Solve the Upper Face&lt;br /&gt;
Organize the Middle Area&lt;br /&gt;
Complete the Yellow Face&lt;br /&gt;
and Finish the Puzzle&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll even discover illuminating, full-color pictures for fully grasping Rubik&amp;rsquo;s cube terms and strategies!&lt;br /&gt;
Finding the solution to a Rubik&amp;#39;s Cube isn&amp;#39;t a Mystery &amp;ndash; It&amp;#39;s a fun hobby!&lt;br /&gt;
With this comprehensive guide book, you&amp;rsquo;ll even learn Rubik&amp;rsquo;s cube terminology for understanding the structure of the cube &amp;ndash; and sharing your passion with other cubers. You&amp;rsquo;ll learn the basics of a simple and powerful Rubik&amp;rsquo;s system, including a special code for easily identifying the various movements you can make. With these easy-to-use mental tools, you&amp;rsquo;ll soon be seeing deep into the cube &amp;ndash; and its 3D mysteries.&lt;br /&gt;
By grasping the clockwise and counterclockwise movements of the Rubik&amp;rsquo;s cube, you&amp;rsquo;ll discover how to think in many directions &amp;ndash; and from many perspectives. While you learn to navigate this unique 3D environment, you&amp;rsquo;ll also learn to see the world around you in a new way. Just like the architect who created this game, you can develop your mind to see things from every angle!" />
