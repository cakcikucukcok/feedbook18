  <title>Corridors (The Geometry, Physics and Mathematics of Chess) Vol 1 - Herman Tolbert Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Chess enthusiast Herman Tolbert Sr takes three of the four elements of chess (space, time, force) and parallels a one to one mapping that relates Geometry, Physics and Mathematics in a unique theme he terms &quot;Corridors&quot;.
Compiling over-the-board tournament experience along with online worldwide games as well as friendly pick-up games, Corridors is a repeated process which eventually zones in on the King or significant material which has game winning advantages.
This work hopes to demonstrate Mr. Tolberts classroom teaching skills and his keen analytical ability to breakdown the complex into simpler form(s) Corridors is a combination of whole or partial rank(s), file(s) and square(s) which are controlled to a lasting degree which yield advantageous results.
Many chess concepts are conveyed by novice to Grandmasters, but this unique work though not for the very beginner can be applied by the many eager-to-improve players; no matter the skill level.
It is with this spirit that Mr. Tolbert wishes to share what he feels is a path of enlightenment, whose fruits of labor is a growth in understanding chess which can only lead to more victories." />
