  <title>How to Hook Your Spouse - Georgene S. Dreishpoon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nothing challenges priority more than a compulsion for sports. &lt;i&gt;How to Hook Your Spouse&lt;/i&gt; is part autobiography and part guidebook for sustaining a marriage. Humorous stories illustrate the life-cycle of bonding with a sports-obsessive using fishing as central metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Georgene Simon Drieshpoon is married to a retired physician who claims in his next life he wants to come back as a fishing guide. He chases the fish. She chases him. She&#39;s been chasing him for forty-nine years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author says, &quot;We joke about compulsions. The term &#39;fishing widow&quot; says it all. The fishermen were not dead, just caught up in their priority. Parenthood changed my priority. It was during this period that my husband and I had our best fights. I was determined not to be a &#39;fishing widow.&#39;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the author fished with her husband, she says, &quot;I&#39;m more like his pocket edition.&quot; Together they have explored the aura of fishing in the United States, Canada, Ireland, Scotland, the Bahamas, and Africa. She&#39;s heard fishermen grumble that &quot;women just don&#39;t understand.&quot; She says, &quot;The same can be said for the other side.&quot; This book is an attempt to humorously enlighten both genders.&lt;/p&gt;" />
