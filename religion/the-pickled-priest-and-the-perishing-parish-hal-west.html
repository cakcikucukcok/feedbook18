  <title>The Pickled Priest and the Perishing Parish - Hal West</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Just as baby boomers comprise the largest generation in Americas history, they also represent the largest percentage of current senior pastors in American churches. Boomer pastors all over the country are struggling to transition from their roots in twentieth-century church culture to ministry and leadership in our challenging twenty-first centuryand this transition &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; take place for traditional churches to be a relevant factor in world redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Pickled Priest and the Perishing Parish: Boomer Pastors Bouncing Back&lt;/em&gt;, Senior Pastor Hal West, himself a baby boomer, offers essential insights and words of inspiration for pastors, leaders, and Christians who desire to see renewal and transformation in their churches, in America, and in themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenges facing traditional churches and the boomer pastors who lead them are many not the least of which are pastors ensconced perspective of their own spiritual formation, theological training, and experience. In his unique, conversational, and at times humorous tone, Pastor Hal West first offers proof through his own pickled perspective and then explores, with help from the lessons of biblical prophets like Isaiah and Nehemiah, how boomer pastors can and must bounce back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change is challenging, but in our day of cultural conflict, political corruption, and spiritual crisis, change is imperative. It falls to church leaders, regardless of their decades of experience in ministry and leadership, to approach transformation with an open mind and provide guidance, vision, and restoration to their churches and the souls they serve.&lt;/p&gt;" />
