  <title>A Return to Eros - Marc Gafni, Kristina Kincaid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discover the secret relationship between erotic, the sexual, and the sacred&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex is not negative or positive. Sex is not just neutral, nor is it merely sacred because it creates babies. None of these old sexual stories work for us anymore. We need a new sexual narrative. This book gives the new sexual narrative, what the authors call Sex Erotic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erotic Mystics from the hidden tradition of Solomon&amp;rsquo;s temple taught a secret doctrine: sex is the source of all wisdom. It&amp;rsquo;s an expression of the erotic impulse of existence itself alive in us&amp;ndash;the yearning for contact, pleasure, and aliveness. The sexual, however, is not the sum total of the erotic. Rather, the sexual teaches us how to live an erotic life in all dimensions of our existence. That is Sex Erotic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Return to Eros: On Sex, Love, and Eroticism in Every Dimension of Life&lt;/em&gt;, from Drs. Marc Gafni and Kristina Kincaid, reveals the radical tenets of the relationships between the sexual, the erotic, and the holy. They share what Eros actually means and also the 12 core qualities of the erotic, which are modeled by the sexual. These include being on the inside, fullness of presence, yearning, allurement, fantasy, surrender, creativity, pleasure, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Return to Eros&lt;/em&gt; shows why these qualities of the erotic modeled by the sexual are actually the same core qualities of the sacred. The relationship between the sexual and the erotic becomes clear, teaching you how to live an erotically suffused existence charged with purpose, potency, and power. To be an empowered lover&amp;mdash;not just in sex but also in all facets of your life&amp;mdash;you must listen to the whisperings of the sexual. Transform your understanding and experience of love, sex, and Eros inside these pages.&lt;/p&gt;" />
