  <title>The Worship Pastor - Zac M. Hicks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Modern worship leaders are restless. They have inherited a model of leadership that equates leading worship with being a rock star. But leading worship is more than a performance, it&#39;s about shaping souls and making disciples. Every worship leader is really a &lt;em&gt;pastor&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Worship Pastor&lt;/em&gt; is a practical and biblical introduction to this essential pastoral role. Filled with engaging, illustrative stories it is organized to address questions of theory and practice, striving to balance conversational accessibility with informed instruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Part One presents a series of evocative &quot;vignettes&quot;--intriguing and descriptive titles and metaphors of who a Worship Pastor is and what he or she does. It shows the Worship Pastor as Church-Lover, Disciple Maker, Corporate Mystic, and Doxological Philosopher.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Part Two covers specific roles related to ministry &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; the worship service itself--the Worship Pastor as Theological Dietician, Caregiver, Mortician, Emotional Shepherd, War General, Prophetic Guardian, Missional Historian, and Liturgical Architect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Part Three looks at ministry &lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt; the worship service--the Worship Pastor as Visionary Teacher, Evangelist, Artist Chaplain, and Team Leader.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some worship leaders are eager to embrace their pastoral role, many are lost and confused or lack the resources of time or money to figure out what this role looks like. Pastor Zac Hicks gives us a clear guide to leading worship, one that takes the pastoral call seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
