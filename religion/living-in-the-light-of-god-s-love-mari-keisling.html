  <title>Living in the Light of God’S Love - Mari Keisling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Abiding may sound passive and inactive, but it is the active process of stayingstaying close to Jesus, focusing on Him, walking with Him, and living in His light. If walking as He did is how our claim to live in Him is realized, then we need to know what He did that we should be doing as well.&lt;br&gt;
Jesus experienced fellowship with His disciples, obeyed His heavenly Father, was humble to the point of death, grew in wisdom and the knowledge of Scripture, and prayed always. God calls each of us to different tasks, places, and purposes, but one thing is consistent for all of us: we cant do any of it or go anywhere without Him. Jesus had His unique purpose in this world as do we, and so just like Him we need to remain in the Father. His life was a living sacrifice, and it is our spiritual act of worship to live like Him.&lt;br&gt;
As we step into Gods light, it will shine truth on our livestruth that is sometimes hard to recognize, hard to acknowledge, and hard to live out. But as we learn to live in His light, He gives us clarity, understanding and transforms us from the inside out. We learn to walk in His light shining it wherever we go. Why?&lt;br&gt;
God loves the whole world, and He loves you. Everything He calls us to do according to His purpose is to show His love to the world and bring glory to Himself. As you work through the disciplines of fellowship, obedience, humility, meditation, prayer, and worship, you will learn how to draw close to the Father, follow the example of Jesus, and shine His light bright for all to see.&lt;/p&gt;" />
