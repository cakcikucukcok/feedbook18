  <title>African Christian Mothers and Fathers: Why They Matter for the Church Today - Mark Ellingsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After almost a millennium and a half, scholars are rediscovering the theological roots of Christianity in ancient North Africa! But we still have a long way to go in bringing these insights to the Church&#39;s consciousness. What has been needed is a careful but accessible analysis of what the great theologians of the region prior to and contemporary with Augustine actually taught about the faith, and why what they said still matters today. African Christian Mothers and Fathers is precisely the book we have needed, an explanation of the theology of these great, though in some cases forgotten, early church leaders for scholars, seminarians, pastors, and laity. Mark Ellingsen, author of an acclaimed book on the thought and life of Augustine, takes readers on an insightful tour of the theological landscape of North Africa and its thought from the late first through the early fifth centuries, and brings us back to the present enriched with ancient but fresh ideas for living the faith." />
