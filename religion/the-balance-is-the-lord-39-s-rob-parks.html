  <title>The Balance Is the Lord&#39;s - Rob Parks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have been blessed to know Rob Parks not only as a brother in the Lord, but also as a dear friend. In The Balance Is the Lords, Rob shares an encouraging word to the body of Christ to draw us into a deeper more intimate fellowship with the Lord. Rob encourages believers and clearly lays out a plan to live a balanced life in Christ to reflect the Lord to a lost and hurting world. He challenges us in the modern Western church to evaluate our value system within the church. Is it our large sanctuaries, big budgets, and professional staff that we value most or our personal relationship with Jesus Christ? 
In chapter two, he discusses how we as believers can handle the difficulties we face in life with a proper, Christ-centered perspective. I have personally observed Rob live this out in his life while walking through the loss of his dear wife, Vicky, with integrity and a steadfastness that can only come from the Lord. Rob not only teaches with wisdom and depth but from the heart through his personal experiences with the Lord. Read the Balance Is the Lords, and it will bring you to a more solid and balanced walk in Christ, which is greatly needed in these desperate and uncertain times we are living in.

Robert is married to Lisa, and they have five children. He has served the body of Christ and the church in various volunteer and leadership roles since high school. He is the Internet marketing director for an RV dealership and serves as a lay elder at The Springs Church, in Colorado Springs, Colorado. 
Good reminder to keep God first in everything we do, the second chapter stuck out to me about stewardship of our time and committing each day to God. We get so caught up in todays business that we put God on the back burner.
