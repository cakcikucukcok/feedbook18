  <title>Let the Ages Roll - Nolan Sluder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;LET THE AGES ROLL is a Bible-based book which expounds the truths in God&#39;s Word about longevity, health, and prosperity.  God&#39;s Word has much to say about His will to lengthen your days, to give you health, and to provide the resources for living and giving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Part Two of this book, the marriage of the author, and his wife Anna plays a very vital roll. They each lost their spouse in 2007. Many years had passed without seeing each other, even though the couples had been long-time friends. After a brief courtship Nolan and Anna were married in 2008. The happiness that came into their life has had a major influence on Part Two of LET THE AGES ROLL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author calls attention to scriptures that encourage seniors to make good choices when facing life alone in their &#39;golden years&#39;. God said, &quot;It is not good that man should live alone&quot; (King James Version). In LET THE AGES ROLL, Nolan addresses the purpose of grief and gives Biblical evidence that grief is meant to be temporary, not permanent. Jesus came that we might have life and have it more abundantly. It is the author&#39;s desire that people love life and live it to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;" />
