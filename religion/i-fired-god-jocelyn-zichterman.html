  <title>I Fired God - Jocelyn Zichterman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;A compelling memoir and account of the Independent Fundamental Baptist church and its shocking history of religious abuse.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jocelyn Zichterman was born, raised, married into, and finally, with her  family, fled the Independent Fundamental Baptist church. Founded by the  fiery preacher Bob Jones, with several hundred thousand members, IFB  congregants are told they must not associate with members of other  Baptist denominations and evangelicals, with an emphasis on secrecy,  insular marriages within the church, a subservience for women, and  unusual child raising practices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;I Fired God,&lt;/i&gt; Jocelyn  Zichterman systematically details the IFB&#39;s disturbing history, exposing  a cult-like atmosphere of corruption, greed, and abuse. Having been  initiated into its innermost circles, Zichterman knows that the gentle  demeanor America sees in the form of the Duggar clan on &lt;i&gt;19 Kids and Counting&lt;/i&gt; disguises the truth about the darker side of the church. &lt;br&gt;With  written documentation and sources so thorough that law enforcement has  used her work as a foundation for criminal prosecutions, Zichterman  exposes the IFB with revelations including: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The disturbing  world of abuse within the IFB and doctors and teachers who cater  exclusively to church members and fail to report physical and sexual  abuse&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The IFB-controlled Bob Jones University, which issues  degrees of questionable value while making vast sums of money for its  founders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The way the IFB influences politics on the local,  state, and national level, and protects its abusive culture under the  constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion&lt;/p&gt;" />
