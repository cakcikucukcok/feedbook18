  <title>The Gift of Salvation - Antonio N. Sherman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Salvation, what is it? Who needs it? Who all can have it? How do you get it? What is my assurance of it and that I truly have it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is your assurance of your salvation? To put it simply, Gods Word is our assurance! His infallible Word, his unchanging Word. Its not a feeling. I have ministered to and have heard so many people say this. I dont feel saved. I am talking about those that say that they are Christian and have accepted Christ. And that is another reason for this book, to help these people to understand salvation. And to help those to understand salvation and to receive Jesus Christ as personal Lord and Savior. Let me share this experience with you. To help you understand your assurance of your salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let no one or nothing shake or doubt your salvation, including yourself. Pray and walk through these chapters with me and find the answers to all these questions and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*What Is Salvation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*No Other Name&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Without Faith&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Believe or Not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*The Seal, the Promise, and Your Guarantee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*The Gift&lt;/p&gt;" />
