  <title>1 Peter, 2 Peter, and Jude: Worship Matters - John Paul Heil</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book proposes new and comprehensive chiastic structures as well as new unifying themes for the often-neglected New Testament letters of 1 Peter, 2 Peter, and Jude. In accord with these structures, which organize the oral performance of these letters in a context of communal worship, the subtitle of the book, Worship Matters, expresses the letters&#39; main concern. By worship is meant not only liturgical worship but also the ethical behavior that complements it for a holistic way of worshiping God. Matters refers not only to the matters or issues regarding worship in these letters but also to the fact that worship matters in the sense of making an all-important difference to Christian living, not only for the original audiences of letters, but equally for their contemporary audience. Accordingly, this book proposes that: 1 Peter exhorts its audience to worship for life, both present and eternal, through the sufferings of Jesus Christ; 2 Peter exhorts its audience to worship in the knowledge regarding the final coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ; and Jude exhorts its audience to worship in the mercy and love of God through our Lord Jesus Christ." />
