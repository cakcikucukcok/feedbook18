  <title>Ministries Administrative Assurance Plan (Maap) - Dr. V.L. Ball</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Proclaimed an uncommon literary work, The Ministries Administrative Assurance Plan is a relevant and highly effective administrative resource with valid solutions for complex ministry needs.
This cutting edge, handy travel companion or desktop resource is a critical must-have for those wanting to build an effective ministry or faith-based organization. Use MAAP to execute distinguishable processes with proven results. This systematic, strategic tool offers a roadmap to become better organized, to develop a strong structure, and to build a plan of action for consistent follow-through that delivers time and time again. MAAP is a biblically sound, clear, and concise resource that offers practical applications. It is easy to implement and encourages faithfulness, integrity, and work ethics from leaders and members alike.
Dr. V. L. Ball has had an inspiring and extremely motivational impact on my life and ministry. Through her extensive international travel, she has touched the lives of many from diverse cultures as evangelist, teacher, pastor, and mentor. 
Ministries Administrative Assurance Plan is an essential tool for apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers, and the layman to enhance administrational skills, providing a foundational guide to make ministry more pragmatically stable for growth and development.
