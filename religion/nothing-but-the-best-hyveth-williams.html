  <title>Nothing but the Best - Hyveth Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="US Senate Chaplain Barry C. Black, PhD. Senate Chaplains Office, S-332, The Capitol, Washington, DC, 20510. He wrote: I look forward to devouring your final chapters, for I have been greatly blessed by what you had previously written. . . I believe this will be a significant contribution to the homiletical literature, combining scholarship and practicality as it is rarely seen, helping to fill a void.
Dr. Derek J. Morris. Director, Hope Channel, and former editor of Ministry Magazine, published by the Seventh-day Adventist Church and read by clergy of all faiths. He responded, This is the best work I have read by an Adventist author on preaching. Its EXCELLENT!
Pastor Adrian Craig. Australian church leader and internationally acclaimed preacher. He said, Here are a few preliminary comments about your excellent book on preaching. In 321 pages, you have packed full a comprehensive and detailed volume on the art of preaching. One has to read and pause and absorb. Your terse verse, one-liners, and the illustrations are readily saleable. Mummies dancing, the description of the horse as it relates to the pace of preaching, the Ravi illustration on page 99, and your repeated use of scripture to illustrate points shouts volumes of your commitment to the Word." />
