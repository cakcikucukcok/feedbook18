  <title>Learning A+ Living - Debra Dingman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Women from all walks of life will be uplifted, encouraged and inspired by relating to an ordinary (and she stresses ordinary in that wearing a business suit and sporting 3-inch heels would be way too uncomfortable, but she wouldnt mind a tummy tuck) American mom/entrepreneur who discovers in reflection of her life, that working was an equal contender to home for where life happens.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Like most women Debra Dingman has always held at least two jobs: One at home and one outside the home be it part-time, full-time, or volunteering for school, Scouts, or church. This is her adventure told through the jobs she held and her family life that was woven in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each chapter unfolds a new phase of life beginning when she is a teenager with her first job and ultimately facing age discrimination as she searches for one later in life. She intimately shares her experiences, and the significant lessons they brought, with an authentic faith, sense of humor, or tears.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Youll read the importance of being teachable and learning all that you can, even from seemingly insignificant work. If you are waiting until you get off work to really engage, you are missing many opportunities to amass skills, wisdom, and joy to bring home to your family.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Following her enthusiasm and capturing her nuggets of heart-felt wisdom will inspire you to keep close to God and help you understand that life, including work, is a faith journey. Debra discovered she earned far more than her (small) paychecks.  She learned an A+ living and you can, too!&lt;/p&gt;" />
