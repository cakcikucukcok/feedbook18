  <title>A Wildflower Grows in Brooklyn: From Striving to Thriving after Sexual Abuse and Other Trauma - Julie Woodley, Clem Boyd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Julie Woodley understands trauma. From physical and sexual abuse as a child, to abortion, through the murder of a dear friend, to brain injury and cancer, she&#39;s experienced more than a lifetime&#39;s worth of pain and loss. But by the grace of God she&#39;s doing more than surviving, she&#39;s thriving. Like a wildflower thrusting itself through a broken sidewalk, God has raised Julie&#39;s joy and hope through the layers of loss and into the light of His plan for her. He has transformed her from a broken receiver of grace into a beautiful blossom who radiates the grace she has received into the lives of other hurting people. Trauma victims often feel weighed down by shame, anger, confusion, and pain. They may be so accustomed to getting by that having passion and joy seems a lost hope. In A Wildflower Grows in Brooklyn, they&#39;ll encounter a story that will inspire them to imagine a life restored and overflowing with all the good things God intends for them." />
