  <title>Don&#39;t Pet the Dragon - C. Michael Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book will not save you from hell nor will it answer all of your questions about spiritual matters. What it will do if you are borderline in determining whether to believe or to reject the idea of God and Satan or of heaven and hell, is to help you with the thinking process. If you are already a believer, hopefully this book will help you develop the study method of going to the Bible with questions. This book reveals how God spoke to me through the events in my life and the people He placed around me; not one soul was there by coincidence or mistake. None of us were just wound up like some toy and turned loose to make it on our own, although I&#39;ve felt that way at times.
This book is about my journey from seeing God as being about religion to knowing Him as my Father and personal Savior. It is about how I moved from thinking of Satan as a religious myth to realizing just how real, evil and active he is in our lives and the lives of those around us.
Believe me, evil is not just a plot in a Steven King movie, it is permeating our society more and more as society turns its back on God, drifting into the secular snare of the dragon. Think about what is considered comedy or what is now considered acceptable for small children in the form of cartoons. Pay attention to the suggestiveness of commercials on television and in magazines. Be more sensitive to the process used to make you believe that being, acting and dressing dumb is cool. Do you no longer wonder about what happened to the high standards that made this nation looked up to? How are we viewed today? Our flag is burned and hung upside down within our own borders." />
