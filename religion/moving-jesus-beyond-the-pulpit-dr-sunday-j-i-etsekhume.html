  <title>Moving Jesus Beyond the Pulpit - Dr. Sunday J. I. Etsekhume</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Moving Jesus beyond the Pulpit: Doing It the Community Way Can Help Church Growth describes the challenges facing Christianity and the church. Although these challenges are very significant, they help to boost the efforts of the present disciples of Christ to be good ambassadors to the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What prompted the writing of this book is that author Sunday J. I. Etsekhume clamored for a dramatic change in the way some churches do outreach. Some churches only prefer to do outreach from the pulpit, but ignored the practice in the community where they are situated. The book also describes various ways in which the church can show love and care, which indicates the various ways that can portray the church healthiness. For I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in; I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me, (Matthew 25:35-36). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book also argues against the idea that church leaders would not compromise their positions as spiritual leaders, due to financial insufficiencies, in order to become fleshy leaders. The arguments further center on how the church can do evangelism without jeopardizing church principles and some of the Christian rules of conduct. Finally, the book focuses on the pulpit, where sermons are preached without the preachers practicing what they preachedhypocrisy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Etsekhume has written an insightful, thoughtful, and thought-provoking rationale for getting back to basics in terms of the way the Church approaches ministry. Moving from pulpit to pew, from leadership to follow-ship, and from minister to member, Dr. Etsekhume identifies the spiritual, organizational, and interpersonal challenges facing the Church and recommends Scriptural principles for addressing them. By turns compassionate and passionate, Moving Jesus Beyond the Pulpit is a wonderful reminder of the restorative, renewing, and revitalizing power of Christ, both in the congregation and in the community at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Associate Minister, Mariners Temple Baptist Church, New York, NY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sunday Etsekhume analyzes some of the issues that address the Church, both from inside the institutional church and issues in the context that hinder the mission of the Church. In this book, one finds thoughtful and pragmatic methods for addressing some of the problems of the church and the larger community! Moving Jesus Beyond the Pulpit is an important work that will be beneficial both to the church and the academy. I highly recommend this work! Dr. Cleotha Robertson, Ph.D. &lt;/p&gt;
