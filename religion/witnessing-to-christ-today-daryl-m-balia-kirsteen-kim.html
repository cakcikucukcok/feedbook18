  <title>Witnessing to Christ Today - Daryl M Balia, Kirsteen Kim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Centenary of the World Missionary Conference, held in Edinburgh in 1910, is a suggestive moment for many people seeking direction for Christian mission in the twenty-first century. Since 2005 an international group has worked collaboratively to develop an intercontinental and multidenominational project, now known as Edinburgh 2010, and based at New College, University of Edinburgh. Essential to the work of the Edinburgh 1910 Conference, and of abiding value, were the findings of the eight think-tanks or ‘commissions’. These inspired the idea of a new round of collaborative reflection on Christian mission – but now focused on nine themes identified as being key to mission in the twenty-first century. The study process is  intended to contribute, from a research perspective, to the aim of Edinburgh 2010 - witnessing together to Christ in the twenty-first century - and to the development of a new vision in terms of God’s purposes for creation in Christ and a renewed spirituality and mission ethos in the life of churches worldwide. Witnessing to Christ Today contains a summary of what has been achieved through the study process up to the end of 2009 and forms the preparatory volume for the centenary conference to be held in Edinburgh on 2-6 June 2010. There the material will be subjected to rigorous critique from various transversal perspectives and engaged with by church and mission delegates from around the world." />
