  <title>My Conversations with God - Henry A. Buchanan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;BACKGROUND: white; MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;&quot;&gt;I wonder a lot about what God is doing in the world. And why He picks &lt;SPAN style=&quot;LETTER-SPACING: 0.1pt&quot;&gt;some of the people he picks to do the things He has them do. I even &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;LETTER-SPACING: 0.05pt&quot;&gt;wonder why He picked me to do what He said He wanted me to do.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;&quot;&gt;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

And He told me. Told me about that Tree of Knowledge &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; LETTER-SPACING: 0.1pt&quot;&gt;of Good and Evil. Told me about Noah and his big boat. About Abraham &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; LETTER-SPACING: -0.05pt&quot;&gt;and Jacob and Joseph down in &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags&quot; /&gt;&lt;st1:country-region&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; LETTER-SPACING: -0.05pt&quot;&gt;Egypt&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; LETTER-SPACING: -0.05pt&quot;&gt; - And Moses and that Goat. Told me &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; LETTER-SPACING: 0.05pt&quot;&gt;about Joshua and the Walls of Jericho. Job on the dung heap. Made me feel better about myself.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;BACKGROUND: white; MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt 0.25pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; LETTER-SPACING: 0.1pt&quot;&gt;I was hesitant to ask Him about His own Son, Jesus. But He talked to &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; LETTER-SPACING: 0.05pt&quot;&gt;me just as if He thought I might be able to understand. And Peter and &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; LETTER-SPACING: 0.1pt&quot;&gt;Paul. And how a man could be struck blind and have his eyes opened &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;&quot;&gt;all at the same time.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

And he took me back again to that Tree of Knowledge and I thought that Tree must be the most wonderful Tree in all Creation. But a greater wonder is that He would &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; LETTER-SPACING: 0.05pt&quot;&gt;talk with me, and give me such a special job to do. I wondered: Why me?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;BACKGROUND: white; MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; LETTER-SPACING: 0.1pt&quot;&gt;Then He said to me. Write it down. And get it right this time. So I wrote it down just the way He told it to me. Now I wonder if I have &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; LETTER-SPACING: 0.15pt&quot;&gt;got it right. And if you who read my tale will get it right because &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; LETTER-SPACING: 0.05pt&quot;&gt;you are one of His People too.
