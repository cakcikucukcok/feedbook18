  <title>The Final World Empire - Paul Garratt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Since the time of the Early Church Fathers, Christians have sought to unravel the mystery of the fourth empire spoken of by the prophet Daniel. Despite the explicit detail provided by Daniel, and the additional insights of the apostle John in the Book of Revelation, the identity of the final world empire has continued to frustrate commentators and polarise popular opinion. And yet now, with the privilege of being able to survey the two-and-a-half millennia that makes up our history since the days of Daniel, we are not only able to correctly identify the fourth empire, but also anticipate the likely sequence of events that will take place in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will transpire that Europe is the location over which a celestial struggle is taking place to revive the fourth empire in preparation for the ascendance of the antichrist. As such, Europe stands as the bloodiest and most anti-Semitic continent on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will discover:&lt;br /&gt;
- The identity of Daniels four world empires.&lt;br /&gt;
- How the fourth empire has undergone seven distinct episodes of revival.&lt;br /&gt;
- The significance of the Roman Catholic Church in the evolution of Europe.&lt;br /&gt;
- Why ancient Babylonian imagery has been embraced by the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current evolution of the European Union is intrinsically linked to Bible prophecy. Understanding what God seeks to do in Europe, at this most anticipated moment in history, will enable you to rise to unparalleled levels of influence in your sphere of ministry.&lt;/p&gt;" />
