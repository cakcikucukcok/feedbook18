  <title>Jump Start Your Day - Pastor Bryan Carter, William Rollings</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With our busy and hectic schedules, we often rush out the door without gaining the fuel needed to make it through the day. Start your day with a positive outlook and great attitude. Learn practical tips on how to successfully face the common situations of everyday life including how to get the most out of your job, reduce financial debt, seek great friendships, properly handle success, avoid compromise, overcome challenges, plan for your future and overcome physical burnout, bitterness, jealousy and anger. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Each lesson is contemporary, practical, and easy to read. Every lesson is organized by an interactive 3 A&#39;s approach - Ask, Answer and Act. As we face the daily challenges of life, we normally &quot;ask&quot; questions to gain insight concerning how to properly deal with our situation. Next, we expect to receive &quot;answers&quot; which provide us with practical insight and advice. Lastly, we &quot;act&quot; upon the advice received if we expect to fully succeed in our situation.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
This devotional challenges readers to seek God&#39;s advice concerning their daily opportunities and obstacles. Readers will be inspired and motivated each morning to take charge of their day with confidence and strive for successful living." />
