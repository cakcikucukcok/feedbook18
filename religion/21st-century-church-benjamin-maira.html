  <title>21St Century Church - Benjamin Maira</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Church of God with Strength 
In the New Testament times, there was a strong church at Ephesus. The church at Ephesus is today&#39;s model of strong church. Paul started the church at Ephesus with great ministry and open doors for the gospel. The church at Ephesus was strong because of the Holy Spirit, Prayer, the Word of God, Faith and the Name of Jesus Christ. After Paul went to be with the Lord and all other witnesses of Jesus Christ and ministers of the word, many churches became weak and they lost their strength and impact. But the church at Ephesus continued to be strong in the Lord and in the ministry. The apostle Paul left a young minister and witness, Timothy continued His ministry. Timothy is respected and recognized as a pastor of the church at Ephesus. Timothy was instructed by pastoral Epistles of Paul (1 and 2 Timothy). Timothy was servant of the Lord Jesus Christ, as a key pastor of this great church. The gift of ministry in his life, he received it by prophecy through the laying on of hands by presbytery. 
The aim to write this book: 21st Century Church, is to strengthen the people of God. Do not be weak, but be strong in the Lord and in the ministry. God has given you the gift of ministry. Be strong in your gift and serve the Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord Jesus Christ who is strong in power and grace is able to strengthen you in all things. In reading 21st Century Church, you will learn about: Jesus Christ and Church, Sound Ministry, Dynamic Holy Spirit, Divine Word and Strong Church. As you read my book on Church strength, may you find strength on your spirit, soul and body. May you be strong in the Lord. May your church also be strong. May the church of today, be the church of strength and longevity." />
