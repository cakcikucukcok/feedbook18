      <meta name="description" content="If something is to be resolved, something must first exist; and if this is so, then where did it originate from? A problem means that the fruit of evil is at work, and you must understand the origin of evil and how it took root. By taking root, which means a seed has been planted and has taken root and has become a problem and it will continue to grow until the root has been destroyed. Answering Americas problem is a short version of how to rid ourselves of the fruit of evil that we are facing today. 
-------------------------
After enduring a life of hardship and pain, God has gifted me to write. When I became isolated from people because I did not want to share my experiences, I began a relationship talking to the Lord. It was during these conversations that God began to reveal himself to me. When I realized that I had been gifted to write the first book, I gave it to the work of God. After time passed, God gave me the second book entitled Answering Americas Problem and he said, This one is for you. This book came about just by communing with God, and he began to reveal the contents written therein. God talked about how important it is to be able to identify a problem. If something is to be resolved, something must first exist. And if you find that something existing, then you must find out where it originated from if you desire to get rid of it. After a problem has been identified, there are measures that have to be taken to get rid of the problem. You must also be able to identify the key player and determine what method is being used because the key player must be exposed. If the key player is not exposed, you can never get rid of him; it will simply be a game of hide and seek. The law of God plays an important role in problem solving when the key player is the devil because the devil always operates opposite God. And unless Gods ways is known, you will not know when the devil is involved. To know what is good and what is bad, you must understand the order in which God operates. When something has become a problem, that means evil is at work. To get rid of the problem, you must understand the origin of evil and how it took root. By taking root, which means a seed has been planted, this will allow the problem to grow and it will continue to grow until the root has been destroyed. Understanding God is the only way to defeat the devil. The devil is a spirit; he is a voice. If he was flesh and blood, we may have a chance at defeating him, but how can we defeat a spiritsomething we cannot see? We can only defeat him by resisting his ways, and God will teach us how through his word. Answering Americas problem is a short version of how to rid ourselves of the problem that we are facing today. The teachings that are written in the book began with me many years ago as I endured so much pain that allowed me to touch the very heart of God. Now the time has come for me to share with the world the things that God has shared with me." />
