  <title>Confessions of a Catholic Street Evangelist - Frederick W. Marks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Citing Scripture, papal documents, and the Catechism of the Catholic Church, Marks explains why every Catholic must be an evangelist. &amp;nbsp;Next, he provides the tools needed to fulfill this obligation regardless of one&amp;#39;s level of training or knowledge. &amp;nbsp;He gives specifics on how parents, pastors, and bishops can lead souls to God. &amp;nbsp;A fair portion of the book is devoted to Marks&amp;#39; experiences as a coordinator for St. Paul Street Evangelization and a speaker for the Catholic Evidence Guild. &amp;nbsp;There are sections that offer advice on how to deal with different groups such as atheists, lapsed Catholics, Evangelicals, Jehovah&amp;#39;s Witnesses, Muslims, Mormons, and Jews. &amp;nbsp;The appendices contain: (a) lists of proof texts arranged by subject that facilitate evangelical give-and-take; (b) the Messianic prophecies side by side with evidence for their fulfillment in the New Testament (chapter and verse); (c) a list of over a hundred classic films that are both decent and entertaining; (d) a compelling account of the greatest miracle of our time; and (e) recommended reading. &amp;nbsp;Central to the book is Marks&amp;#39; demolition of myths that stand in the way of evangelization -- i.e. relativism (situation ethics); the idea that religion is a private matter; the notion that one mustn&amp;#39;t argue; that one mustn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;impose&amp;quot; one&amp;#39;s values&amp;nbsp;on others, and so forth. &amp;nbsp;Finally, he points up the fact that the mainline media does all it can to hide the connection between closeness to God and creativity on the part of the world&amp;#39;s greatest achievers in fields such as painting, literature, and musical composition. &amp;nbsp;A good alternate title for Marks&amp;#39; Confessions&amp;nbsp;would be &amp;quot;Apologetics Made Easy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
