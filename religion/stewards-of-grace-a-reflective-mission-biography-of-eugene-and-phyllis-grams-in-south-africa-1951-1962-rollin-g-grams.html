  <title>Stewards of Grace: A Reflective, Mission Biography of Eugene and Phyllis Grams in South Africa, 1951-1962 - Rollin G. Grams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Stewards of Grace tells several stories in one. It is a story of two faithful stewards of God&#39;s grace called to serve the poor, despised, and marginalized in apartheid South Africa. It is a story that captures how cross-cultural missions from the west at the end of the colonial era led to a thriving church in the southern hemisphere. It is a story of God&#39;s power to redeem and transform the lost, heal the sick, and build the church of Jesus Christ. It is a story of the positives and negatives of Pentecostal missions in its third generation in the mid-twentieth century. And it is a story of radical Christian discipleship.  Written first for those who would like to know the story of the first of six decades of ministry for Eugene and Phyllis Grams, this book also reflects on mission theology and practice. The very personal story is full of painful struggles and amazing miracles, human opposition and divine triumph, and examples of how God&#39;s plan works through and despite human weaknesses for the praise of his glory and grace. Reflection on ministry, missions, theology, and the Christian life are based on Scripture, history, and the Grams&#39; personal experiences. The biographical narrative explores such things as the call to Christian service, evangelism, church planting, justice, compassion, cross-cultural ministry, partnerships, and spiritual power. The result is both a riveting biography and a narrative theology of mission practice to challenge and encourage every believer." />
