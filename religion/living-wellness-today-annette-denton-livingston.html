  <title>Living Wellness Today - Annette Denton Livingston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div id=&quot;00N40000001lfGm_ileinner&quot;&gt;Sit a while and have a cup of hot tea while reading about my lifes journey from having no hope to the fullness of life and years of enjoying family, friends, and pets. Perhaps you will be inspired to carry on with your own healing journey, despite seemingly insurmountable obstacles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes just reading about someone who has suffered the throngs of despair and somehow got out of it can be encouraging. In this day and age so many people are being diagnosed with serious problems. Have you looked into the face of a doctor who was saying to you Get your affairs in order? There is no cure The thought, no hope has a way of sinking in and taking one to depths unknown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years before my diagnosis I had already begun a search for something that would make me feel better. I started with whole wheat bread and weight programs. Later I tried the Reams biological theory of ionization, vitamins and minerals and herbs, enemas and colonics, juicing and green drinks, fasting, raw foods and wheatgrass. Next I tried chiropractic, craniosacral therapy, ayurvedic medicine, massage, acupuncture, bad tasting teas, magnets, zappers, kombucha tea, ma rollers, citrine stones, music therapy, and emotional freedom technique. I found that the main therapies that work for me are reflexology, qigong, a macrobiotic eating plan and lifestyle, hypnosis, and prayer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you have a desire to feel better? Do you feel like life is passing you by? Would you like to have more fullness of life? Floating along downstream will only leave us washed up on the bank or swallowed up in the current. Remember that there are ways to help ourselves, whether we are strong and healthy or whether we have given up. There is always hope as long as there is breath.&lt;/div&gt;" />
