  <title>Extraordinary Freedom - Anam Tbubten, Dana Marsh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Extraordinary Freedom is an approachable and straightforward invitation to open to life, to inquire within, and to go beyond confusion and live in the light of awareness. Although the book isnt filled with the esoteric language of the Buddhist tradition, it has the depth of this powerful wisdom tradition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By becoming conscious of our inner world, our habits, beliefs, neurosis, and attachments there is an opportunity to see their empty nature and in doing so transform our lives. The wisdom we need is already within us, it is who we are. By living in awareness and gaining insight we discover this for ourselves. In order to reveal this wisdom in our consciousness we need to try on a new way of seeing and relating to life and all the conditions it presents, then the extraordinariness of who we are can reveal itself and the chains that bind us to old hardened views will break. We can experience extraordinary freedom moment by moment, embracing all that life offers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people need a book like this which is simple in its language &lt;br /&gt;
and profound in its meaning. Anam Thubten&lt;/p&gt;" />
