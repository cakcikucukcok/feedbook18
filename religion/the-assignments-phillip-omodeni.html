  <title>The Assignments - Phillip Omodeni</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book, The Assignments, was inspired when my son Timothy was seriously ill and admitted into hospital while we, the parents, were abroad on a visit to family and friends. He was diagnosed with bacterial meningitis and was in a coma for almost a week. The doctors were negative and very discouraging. We declare and engaged the sprinkling blood as a spiritual disinfectant against the bacteria called meningitis. We also stood in prayer by faith that was hung on the revelation that this is an assignment for God. Our son was restored unscratched. Praise God! Jonahs and Mosess experiences by their assignments were contrasted in the book, and it was concluded that for every given assignment, there is a God-driven plan. A vision given by God is a vision driven by God (Phillip Omodeni)." />
