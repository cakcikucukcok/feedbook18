  <title>Blood of the Lamb Catholic Bible Study - Beth Leonard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If blood were money, then Jesus left this world penniless. For our sake and the will of his Father, Jesus completely emptied himself for the amassed debt of mankind. From the droplets of circumcision to the outpouring of blood and water upon the cross, Jesus gave all he had to give so we might share in his resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Holy Scripture waits for our stillness before it speaks to us, for its great value and mysterious contents are hidden from the one who passes by quickly. For the one who sits with patience, it speaks volumes, revealing worth and fortune we did not know were possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Blood of the Lamb Catholic Bible Study &lt;/em&gt;creates an atmosphere for learning, reflecting and sharing. By blending Holy Scripture, Catechism and Liturgy with anecdotal stories, it strikes a refined balance to studying the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Intentionally decide to snuggle closer to God, stretch yourself to use the gifts given to you and open your heart a bit wider. You will be amazed at the graces He wants to pour out to you, through the Blood of the Lamb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scripture is best when it is memorable, useful, and fruitful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
