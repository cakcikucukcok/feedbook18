  <title>Freedom’S Song - K. Wayne Keillor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Freedoms Song is both an expanded translation and a one-of-a-kind interpretation of the life of Jesus. It is a fresh portrait of him based on primary source documents, namely, the four gospels of the Christian scriptures. In this story, these documents are harmonized and arranged into a highly probable chronological narrative. To add depth and flavor, and bring about a greater understanding of Jesus discourses, illustrations, homilies, and deeds, cultural and political beliefs and practices of the first-century are incorporated into the book. 
The Prologue opens with a celestial sign that appeared to Magi priests about fifteen months before Jesus was born. This is followed with a discussion of his pedigree and his person. Part I covers the Inauguration of Freedom, from Jesus unique birth to his first Passover in Jerusalem as a youth. It then jumps forward eighteen years to his baptism, personal testing as Gods Liberator, recruitment of his first six disciples, and, finally, his first power deed. Part II focuses on the Battle for Freedom. It covers approximately two years of Jesus ministryhis tour of Galilee with the gospel, identification of himself as the God-man, sermon about Gods kingdom, dispatching apostles to spread the good news, teaching by parables, visiting Jerusalem, and his warning to the religious leaders of his day. Part III includes Freedoms Victory, coincidentally the denouement of Jesus life. He is back in Jerusalem for another Passover and a final gathering with the apostles. And here he is arrested, tried, and crucified as a common criminal. The story ends with Freedoms SongJesus is alive!" />
