  <title>The Art of Wayfare - Imam Fazian Muhammad al-Faizi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Al-Shaikh Abu Madyan al-Gawth, the great axis of sainthood once remarked, The Truth Most High places on the tongues of the scholars of all times with that which is befitting and needed by the people of the time. This work is a befitting example of this, in that it is an exposition of the path to God Most High  the quintessential facet of humanity  explained in a style and manner that is most appropriate and pertinent for the need of the time. Having recognized people going in to oblivion and mass heedlessness, the author has penned (which Ive been told almost entirely from memory without recourse to books) this unique work which is captivating but at the same time highly methodical and serves as a practical guide to relocating humanity back on the track to the Divine pleasure.
I sincerely pray that this book remains a means of guidance and direction for all of humanity, a humanity  one might add  that is plagued by impending threats of international conflict across the globe. Indeed if humanity were to engage in the Art of wayfare, then Warfare may never arise and peace would always thrive. May God bless Imam Faizan for this endeavor; and make him an immense means of restoration of the pristine way of the Last and Ultimate Messenger of God, our Master Muhammad. (May the peace and blessings of God descend up on him and also up on his progeny and companions). Ameen.
