  <title>A Message from the Throne Room - Anita Lahanmi, Carol Efueye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sometimes, an appropriate message at just the right time may be the difference between whether a person lives or dies; whether a person is victorious or is swept away in ignominious defeat; whether a person is miraculously healed, or passes away under the ravages of a wasting disease; whether a person is freed from the chains and shackles of a debilitating addiction, or remains an unwilling but helpless captive to destructive substances. At times like these it becomes incumbent that this life-saving message is committed to the hands of a faithful messenger, one who will not distort, pervert or re-engineer the message.
It is noteworthy also that the more important a message is, the more careful is the selection process for the vessel chosen to bear the tidings. Since God and His Word are one, He jealously guards its impartation.
A Message from the Throne Room is a prophetic word in season from God to His children and is designed for times such as these. God has chosen a vessel with whom He shares deep intimacy to bear the glad tidings that this book represents. It is obvious that some of the deep revelations could only have come from intense, unalloyed fellowship.
Essentially, the book is about faith without which of course God says you cannot please Him. You need faith to receive healing, to face your fears, to discover your lifes purpose, to deal with low self-esteem. You also need faith to find direction as well as in times of need, while waiting on God and battling insecurities. Finally A Message from the Throne teaches you how to stay anchored during lifes storms and when you are feeling discouraged. It concludes by calling you to examine the sovereignty of God.
Cast in the style of a daily devotional, this is a book that can be digested by both young and mature believers alike. Sit back and digest for your good and that of the world around you, this undiluted, refreshing Message from the Throne Room.
