  <title>Pornocide - Greg Gerber, Kary Oberbrunner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Pornography is no longer a problem in the world; it is an epidemic trapping millions of men, women and children in a hopeless cycle of guilt, shame, anger and defeat. It leaves a trail of broken marriages, sexualized children, lost jobs, and unfulfilled dreams in its wake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies show nearly two-thirds of men, one in five women and one in three pastors regularly visit sexually explicit websites. It is estimated that at least one-quarter of employees use work computers to view pornography on company time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, 90 percent of boys and 60 percent of girls were exposed to pornography before their 18th birthday. Today, children between the ages of 9 and 17 are among the world&amp;rsquo;s largest producers of pornography thanks to technological advances in cell phones and webcams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pornocide: Why Lust is Killing Your Faith, Stealing Your Joy and Destroying Your Life&lt;/em&gt; is unique. It&amp;rsquo;s a fictional story based on his personal struggle to overcome a pornography habit that spanned four decades. It&amp;rsquo;s a tale of a man who is caught in his sin and, through a series of divine appointments, develops addiction-crushing, mountain-moving faith to finally enjoy complete freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By resting in God&amp;rsquo;s grace and tapping into important spiritual principles, you, too, can be free from the devastating consequences of lust and pornography. will show you how to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use effective weapons to wage war against a very powerful enemy seeking to ruin your life.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Plant seeds of faith which, over time, produce a rewarding harvest of self-respect and genuine relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Tap into the healing power of a loving God who is cheering for your success at every turn.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Avoid the slippery slope of pornography that will take you places you don&amp;rsquo;t want to go and from which it is very difficult to return.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Understand how your brain reacts to pornography by stimulating an unyielding desire for more&amp;mdash;and what you can do to defeat the vicious cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Respond appropriately to repeated failure until you&amp;rsquo;re strong enough to simply walk away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pornocide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a captivating book you&amp;rsquo;ll find hard to put down. However the strategies outlined in it will help you overcome not only lust and pornography, but any mountain in your life. Don&amp;rsquo;t allow yourself to remain trapped in bondage to a demanding and unforgiving master. Isn&amp;rsquo;t it time you restored joy, peace, and a sense of purpose to your life?&lt;/p&gt;" />
