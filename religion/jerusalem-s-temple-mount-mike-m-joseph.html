  <title>Jerusalem’S Temple Mount - Mike M Joseph</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There seem to be no other place on earth, if desecrated or conquered, that could inflame and arouse the intense passions of countless of devout believers.  Jews, Christians, or Muslims feel the ultimate focal point of their uncompromising desire for dominion and presence in that most holy place is the reason for the ever explosive tinder box in the turbulent Middle East.  The ground zero of this focal point is The Temple Mount in Jerusalem.  The Crusaders marched on Jerusalem to liberate it and The Temple Mount from the Muslim infidels.  Salah a- Din marched on Jerusalem to re-conquer it and The Temple Mount from the Christian infidels. In the Six Day War Jews have finally reclaimed the city and their Temple Mount from the Muslim infidels.  Ever since, Jews, Christians, and Muslims have never given up their non-negotiable intense desire to have an absolute dominion over The Holy City and The Temple Mount.
Jews have religious and historic reasons for maintaining absolute control over Jerusalem and especially The Temple Mount.  Christians have similar feelings.  Muslims maintain, according to their beliefs, that Jerusalem is holy because their prophet Muhammad has ascended up to Heaven from the mosque located in The Temple Mount.
Shockingly as it may sound, though Jerusalem is The Holy City, what is believed to be the location of The Temple Mount is nothing, though unintentionally, but a hoax  the Hoax of the Millennium.  In the pages of this work, this audacious contention to many, will be amply proven, beyond the shadow of a doubt, from the pages of the Bible as well as from faithful historic accounts of Jews, contemporary non- Jewish historians, Christian and Muslim recorded and preserved accounts." />
