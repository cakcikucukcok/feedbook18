  <title>The Mystical Captive - Marilynn Hughes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE MYSTICAL CAPTIVE (An Out-of-Body Travel Book): The Mystical Captive attempts to lay out a comprehensive Mystical Theology based on the mystical experiences and studies of Marilynn Hughes. With the simple premise that a soul which has been taken captive by the fiery love of God will undergo a series of expected and vital processes in its journey to ever widening union with God, ‘The Mystical Captive’ sets out to ease the journey and make it more meaningful, understandable and easy to follow as the different stages erupt in the life of the captive.  
Being captive insinuates to some extent that there is no choice in the matter which is precisely the point. Once a soul is taken captive by God, their lives will never be the same. Prepare then, to enter into the bridal chamber of the Lord for once it begins, the journey will never end. You will become a captive heart." />
