      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Called with a mandate to encourage Gods people to become all that God has created them to be, author Billy B. Matiyabo has a passion and gift for proclaiming the Word of God and in being sensitive to the voice of the Holy Spirit. In Fifty Days for an Enduring Ministry of Encouragement, he presents a collection of devotionals that he prepared and sent weekly to his local church to support the congregations faith journey.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The devotionals share his experiences and ideas about Christian faith, using personal anecdotes and stories to illustrate how God works in the lives of the faithful. He explores some of the obligations and responsibilities of Christians and illustrates how to find comfort and guidance in the Bible. Fifty Days for an Enduring Ministry of Encouragement covers a wide range of topics including fear, anxiousness, trust, praise, joy, the call of God, generosity, the power of testament, and confession.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Matiyabo provides these devotionals as a resource to help believers stand for the truth in the midst of hostility and the encouragement they need to hold fast to eternal truths in a godless milieu.&lt;/P&gt;" />
