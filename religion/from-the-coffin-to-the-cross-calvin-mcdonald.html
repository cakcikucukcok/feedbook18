  <title>From the Coffin to the Cross - Calvin McDonald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a prophetic vision, God showed me the evangelical churches of North America channeling all their spiritual energy into the works of their own hands, enshrining these works as a divine manifestation of God while living in rebellion to His word of truth. We have forsaken the mandate of the Azusa Street Revival and have been shutting the door more and more to all possibilities for any future revivals and awakenings in North America. If the church does not wake up from its spiritual slumber, all will soon be lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purpose of this book is to reveal to the body of Christ in North America and the rest of the world where we have gone wrong and how to turn back to God in much-needed repentance. It is my prayer that through this book, a new spirit of righteousness will be awakened in true believers everywhere and that they would be energized into a new mindset of desiring something authentic from Gods Holy Spirit, no longer clinging to that which is religious and familiar. Lord let the evangelical churches of North America be set free from the entanglements of their own cultural and social bondages and allow the true love of Jesus Christ to reign in their hearts, churches, and communities. Let the real spirit of the Christ be their guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
