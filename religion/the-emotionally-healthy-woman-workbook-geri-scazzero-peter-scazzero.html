  <title>The Emotionally Healthy Woman Workbook - Geri Scazzero, Peter Scazzero</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Geri Scazzero knew there was something desperately wrong with her life. She felt like a single parent raising her four young daughters alone. She finally told her husband, &amp;ldquo;I quit,&amp;rdquo; and left the thriving church he pastored, beginning a journey that transformed her and her marriage for the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this eight-session video Bible study (DVD/digital video sold separately), Geri provides you a way out of an inauthentic, superficial spirituality to genuine freedom in Christ. This&amp;nbsp;study is for every woman who thinks, &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t keep pretending everything is fine!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The journey to emotional health begins by quitting. Geri quit being afraid of what others think. She quit lying. She quit denying her anger and sadness. She quit living someone else&amp;rsquo;s life. When you quit those things that are damaging to your soul or the souls of others, you are freed up to choose other ways of being and relating that are rooted in love and lead to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you quit for the right reasons, at the right time, and in the right way, you&amp;rsquo;re on the path not only to emotional health, but also to the true purpose of your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sessions include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quit Being Afraid of What Others Think&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quit Lying&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quit Dying to the Wrong Things&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quit Denying Anger, Sadness and Fear&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quit Blaming&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quit Overfunctioning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quit Faulty Thinking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quit Living Someone Else&amp;rsquo;s Life&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designed for use with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Emotionally Healthy Woman Video Study&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(sold separately).&lt;/p&gt;" />
