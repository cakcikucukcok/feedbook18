  <title>Unlikely Heroes of the Good News - William Doyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The first half of this book highlights the lives of men and women of biblical fame and in the second half fearless heroes of the truth, in our times; men and women who at a pivotal point in their lives were guided by their Higher God-Mind to serve the purposes of the Ultimate Reality  God. This book draws attention to ordinary people with extraordinary ways, noble characters whose lives are a shining example in our communities showing that with diligence and faith we can all reach the plateau of righteousness, improve our own landscape and go on to make a difference. The lives of these men and women are a testimony of Gods grace and challenge to all Christians to wake up from spiritual sleep and seek the mind of God; to work with His Spirit in the community in which they live. 
Never has there been a time when the consciousness of men has been so assailed with misguided philosophy and questionable values. This book brings into focus the wisdom of the author and a much needed message for our times." />
