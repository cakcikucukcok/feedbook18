  <title>I Love Thy Law:  An Expository Study of the Book of Revelation - Mr. Christopher Bickish</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of this commentary is to aid the believer in understanding and applying a book which is not only prophetic but extremely practical. Revelation contains many difficult passages. In some instances, exact interpretation is impossible. Where more than one interpretation is possible, I have tried to present honestly the possibilities, and where the passage is silent, I have tried to remain silent. I have not tried to make a definite connection between modern day nations and the nations of the end times; in reality, the nations of today may not be in existence by the time this book comes to pass in its fullness. Honesty and loyalty to the Greek and Hebrew text of Scripture is crucial; I have given diligence to the study and exegesis of the Greek Textus Receptus behind the King James translation. Also, I appreciate the accuracy, honesty and integrity of the King James translation; therefore, apart from my own rendering of the Greek text, it is the only English translation used in this work." />
