  <title>Still Moving: The Journey of Love&#39;s Perfection - Robert C. Pelfrey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Speaking about love, Jesus said we should be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect. Was Jesus joking? Was he setting us up for failure? Or was Jesus offering us a greater experience of God&#39;s love than we are currently settling for? Still Moving is about the journey of love&#39;s perfection. God wants to make us perfect in love in this life. And God wants us to strive after God&#39;s perfect and perfecting love.   Still Moving is for individuals and groups seeking to give shape to their formation, to clarify the goal of their faith, and to live in deeper intimacy with God. Areas include:  -Learning and living God&#39;s will for your life and for the world -Joining your life story to God&#39;s story and cultivating the mind of Christ -Simplifying your bodily life and experiencing God&#39;s power in your body -Living intentionally from the deepest part of your being in union with God -Tearing down personal and societal walls of prejudice, class, violence, and ideology  Still Moving includes sections for group discussion or further personal exploration and action. So let&#39;s go! The journey of love&#39;s perfection begins with the first step." />
