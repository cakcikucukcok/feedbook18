  <title>Finding Hope in This World of Turmoil - Trevor Bartley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The resurrection message is the most important part of our belief system.
Without the truth of the resurrection message, our faith is just another religion with no real substance. The Resurrection sets Christianity apart. This book is dedicated to establishing this truth.
The extent of the work of Christs resurrection is staggering. However, if there is one topic that is the central message of the Bible, it is the sacrifice of Christ. The Old Testament looks forward to it, whereas the New Testament looks back at it.
We must be extremely careful not to allow these two ordinances to become routine in our Christian life (communion and baptism) and thereby reduce the significance of what Jesus did for us at his sacrifice and resurrection. The greatest gift that anyone can be given is eternal life, and the one that made that possible is Jesus. In Christ, we have victory, provided we see ourselves dead to sin and raised together with him.
Even so consider yourselves also dead to sin and your relation to it broken, but alive to God [living in unbroken fellowship with Him] in Christ Jesus (Romans 6:11, AMP).
I have been crucified with Christ [in Him I have shared His crucifixion]; it is no longer I who live, but Christ (the Messiah) lives in me; and the life I now live in the body I live by faith in (by adherence to and reliance on and complete trust in) the Son of God, Who loved me and gave Himself up for me. [Therefore, I do not treat Gods gracious gift as something of minor importance and defeat its very purpose]; I do not set aside and invalidate and frustrate and nullify the grace (unmerited favor) of God. For if justification (righteousness, acquittal from guilt) comes through [observing the ritual of] the Law, then Christ (the Messiah) died groundlessly and to no purpose and in vain. [His death was then wholly superfluous.] (Galatians 2:2021, AMP).
We need to remember that the story doesnt end with Jesuss death. He is currently in heaven, in his resurrected body, and one day, he will return. The resurrection of Jesus was an act of the supreme love of God.
Remember, our identification is in who we are in Christ and his resurrection. The Bible tells us in John 14:12 that the things Christ has done we can do, and greater than these we will do because he goes to the Father. The resurrection demonstrated Jesuss victory over the power of death and confirms there is life beyond the grave.
Jesus Christ offers us a resurrection power beyond ourselves that can make us alive; it empowers us to overcome the limitations of this realm with an infused ability as we focus on the Spirit of power working within us. 
I hope you receive much insight and revelation as you discover the wholeness of what Jesus achieved for you and me." />
