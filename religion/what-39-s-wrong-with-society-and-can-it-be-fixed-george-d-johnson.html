  <title>What&#39;s Wrong with Society and Can It Be Fixed? - George D. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Reverend George D. Johnsons Whats Wrong With Society and Can it Be Fixed? was written as a backdrop to the tragic events of Columbine High School in Colorado. It is a short and to the point treatise that sets a powerful stage for telling us about some of the ills of society.  Whats Wrong With Society informs us that societys ills are truly due to a moral breakdown in the soul and character of America.  Whats Wrong With Society also informs us that we must practice what we preach, practice what we know is right, and practice love.  Johnson writes that the average educational level in American society today is 9th grade.  With this said, no wonder we have a moral breakdown in society today.  The unlearned simply cannot teach or appear to unwillingly want to be taught.  The learned are too busy trying to fattened their pockets and commit grand larceny through the system in order to achieve their material goals to live comfortably and large in society. 
The sins we commit are the problems of society such as systematic grand theft, petty thievery, sexual immorality, child abuse (child neglect, abandonment, molestation, etc.), spousal abuse, lack of love for each other, racism, sexism, classism, to name a few. Whats Wrong With Society basically tells us that MEism is a major problem.  Too many people in society are concerned ONLY about themselves.  They are interested only in what is good for them, what is bad for them, what is possible for them and what they can get and how much of it they can get at the expense of others.  That is, Whats Wrong With Society informs us that people are basically selfish: the big I and little YOU.
Whats Wrong With Society provides us with a myriad of scripture to help us get back on a moral track.  It provides us with hope. Johnson tells us that, The great Teacher told us when He was on earth that after His death and resurrection He would come again to establish His Kingdom here on earth. Likewise, The Apostle Paul who was probably the second greatest teacher on earth echoed almost the same words some thirty or forty years later, according to Johnson.  These are encouraging statements.  When the great Teacher, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ returns, we have hope that the ills of all societies will be corrected.  However, only those individuals who accept the great Teacher as Lord and Savior of their souls will be better equipped to deal with the ills of society before our great Teacher returns, if they walk by faith.  Johnson implores us to take one day at a time and be doers of Gods Word.  When individuals truly obey Gods word, they will see the fruit of Gods blessings." />
