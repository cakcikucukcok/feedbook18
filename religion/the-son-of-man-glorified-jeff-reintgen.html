  <title>The Son of Man Glorified - Jeff Reintgen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;John 13:3132: &lt;br /&gt;
So, when he had gone out, Jesus said, Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in Him. If God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and glorify Him immediately. &lt;br /&gt;
Jesus Christ, the second Adam, the Son of Man, glorified God by His obedience to the cross. This work of redemption is the basis by which all the counsels of God are accomplished. All that God does for man, all that He works out on mankinds behalf, has its foundation upon the death of the Son of Man. God will eventually gather all thingsin heaven and on earthinto the raised and glorified Christ. &lt;br /&gt;
God will be glorified in all that He does, and He has exalted the resurrected Son of Man to His right hand in glory. This is where it begins. When this Man had finished His work, He forever sat down in regards to a completed redemption (Heb. 10:12). From this point, all Gods counsels begin to unfold. If the believer will read this book, and ask the Spirit of God to teach you, you will never be the same. All of Scripture will open up to you. The believer has been given the Spirit of God that you may know all these things and you have the mind of Christ (I Cor. 2:12,16). Now the Son of Man is glorified &lt;/p&gt;" />
