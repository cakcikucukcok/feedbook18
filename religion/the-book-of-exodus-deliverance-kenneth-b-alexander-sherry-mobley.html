  <title>The Book of Exodus - Deliverance - Kenneth B. Alexander, Sherry Mobley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Exodus is the story of the deliverance of God&amp;#39;s people from Egypt. For hundreds of years the Israelites had prospered in Goshen where they had settled since the time of Joseph. They had prospered in Goshen and become very fruitful and had increased in population. However the scripture says a new King arose over Egypt, who did not know [the legacy of] Joseph. He said to his people, &amp;quot;Behold, the people of the sons of Israel are more and mightier than we. &amp;quot;Come, let us deal wisely with them, or else they will multiply and in the event of war, they will also join themselves to those who hate us, and fight against us and depart from the land&amp;quot; (Ex. 1:8-10). The Pharaoh decided on a plan of action that would reduce the number of Israelites in Egypt. He called for the extermination of all Hebrew born males. He also essentially made the Israelites slaves. &amp;quot;So they appointed taskmasters over them to afflict them with  hard labor. And they built for Pharaoh storage cities, Pithom and Raamses (Exodus 1:10-11). &amp;quot;The Egyptians compelled the sons of Israel to labor rigorously; and they made their lives bitter with hard labor in mortar and bricks and at all kinds of labor in the field, all their labors which they rigorously imposed on them&amp;quot; (Ex 1:13-14).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This set the stage for Moses, who was raised in Egypt, to accept God&amp;#39;s commission to deliver the Israelites from their slavery in Egypt. Moses went back into Egypt with Aaron his brother and set about to do God&amp;#39;s will. Moses performed the greatest miracles ever performed until Christ including the death of every firstborn Son in Egypt on the day of Passover. As he left Egypt he was pursued by Pharaoh and his armies. Moses parted the Reed Sea (some translations Red Sea), the Israelites crossed but Pharaoh&amp;#39;s army was drown as the waters came back. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moses set up camp with the Israelites in the desert wilderness. While there he received the Law of God on Mt. Sinai including the 10 commandments. The Law was instituted in the Israeli camp and Feast days were ordained. The details of Israel&amp;#39;s stay in the wilderness are continued in the Book of Numbers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As we shall see here and in the book of Leviticus the Exodus has great spiritual significance to believers in Christ today. As Christ delivered all people on the cross from slavery to corruption so Moses delivered the Israelites from slavery of another kind. While Moses was performing God&amp;#39;s miracles God was bringing judgment on the pagan gods of Egypt, the greatest civilization in the land. Each judgment corresponded to an Egyptian god. The Passover is rich in Christian significance (see below). The Feast of Booths and the Day of Atonement represent Christ&amp;#39;s forgiving work on the cross. Moses received the Law on Mt. Sinai which Law becomes our teacher in leading us to Christ. Moses also established Israel as a Nation as he became their Lawgiver and mouthpiece of God.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The priesthood was created and instituted by the tribe of Levi. A tabernacle (or sacred tent) was constructed after the pattern that would reflect Solomon&amp;#39;s temple built later. The ark of the covenant was constructed which contained the presence of God and went before the Israelites in all battles. Likewise animal sacrifices were instituted for forgiveness of sin. The Lord provided a cloud by day for shade and a pillar of fire by night for light and warmth. This is just as Christ cares for His people&amp;#39;s every need. Food was also rained down from heaven every day as Christ gives each his/her daily bread of the Word. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moses faced rebellion in the wilderness which resulted in swift judgment as Christ will judge all rebellion in the last days. He endured numerous grumblings by the children of Israel and was blamed for their every discomfort. The man Moses was called the most humble man on the earth at that time.
