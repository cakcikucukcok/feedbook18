  <title>What Does God Say About Me? - Cheryl A. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee: and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee and I ordained thee (Jeremiah 1:5) 
The Lord declares that before He formed us, He knew us, sanctified us and ordained us to greater destiny. The Lord further decrees that the thoughts He thinks toward us will always have a positive impact on our lives. Yet, we are not experiencing these promises. Rather, we find ourselves living beneath our privilege and accepting defeat. Why? Is it because we have chosen to accept how the world defines us and labels us, instead of proclaiming what God has spoken about us? Does our speech line up and agree with what God says about us? Our tongue is the pen of a ready writer. (Psalm 45:1) What are our tongues writing? Do we speak defeat or victory? 
This book has been written to challenge us to find out what God says about us and to apply His Words to our lives. When we speak the promises, proclamation and pronouncements of God into our spirits and out into the atmosphere, we will reach the expected potential that God has preordained for our lives. 
Man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that precedes out of the mouth of God. (Matthew 4:4)" />

You are dead to sin and alive to me, and I will never stop doing good to you.”<br /><b><i>What Does God Say About Me? It's Better Than You Imagined</i></b> | Question: "What does God say about me?" Answer: Before we look at what the Bible says about an individual, we need to dismantle a concept that is growing in popularity within modern Christianity. A misleading message, espoused by various media preachers, best-selling authors, and prosperity teachers, is that it is ALL about me.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>What Does God Say About Me? - Cheryl A.
