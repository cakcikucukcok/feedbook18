  <title>Decoding the Mind of God - Margret Ann Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Decoding the Mind of God&lt;/i&gt; author O. M Kelly delves into the unconscious mind and discovers the secrets of the collective consciousness, showing how we can realize the potential of the human mind through belief in ourselves. The Laws of the universe are identical to the collective consciousness, they reveal an answer to every question we are capable of asking. We constantly receive these answers through the vibrations of the energy fields through our being, all without us knowing how to realign our intelligence with our unconscious mind. The truth remains hidden to us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprising as it may seem, the key to understanding ourselves lies in a mathematical language, which is the make-up of the unconscious mind. Kelly explores this language through the texts and myths of myriad cultures and belief systems, notwithstanding the truth of the science behind the Egyptian Hieroglyphs and the stories collected in the Bible. As we read this volume we realize that all of these stories are connected to our own story within. Kellys perceptions of the order of higher consciousness are framed by stories from her experiences of personal discovery and over twenty years of researching, lecturing and teaching all around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Once these codes are unveiled, we earn our freedom where we can release the fear in which humanity habitually traps itself,  creating our accidents, diseases, why we die, right up to explaining extra terrestrial intelligence. This book exposes the secret codes of the universal language that will help us achieve the divine unity with the universe and ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;" />
