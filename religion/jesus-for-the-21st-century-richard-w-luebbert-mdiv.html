Do you want Hope and Love? Readers of the 21st century are looking for such spiritual, social and cultural values in themselves, in other people and in a wide variety of other places. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Bible reveals truths about the values you may be seeking. The example of Jesus and his teachings in the gospels may provide the answers to many of your questions and problems. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; There are four gospels in the Bible, each telling the story of Jesus. Some episodes are included in each gospel which are omitted by one or more of the other three gospels. Some details included in one gospel are not found in the telling of the same episode in the other gospels. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Therefore, this editor has sought to combine the four gospels with all the details and nuances of all four into a single narrative without adding to or omitting any event, dialogue or comment which the four evangelists wrote. &lt;/p&gt;" />
