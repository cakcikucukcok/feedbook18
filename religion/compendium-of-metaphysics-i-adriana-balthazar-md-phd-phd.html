  <title>Compendium of Metaphysics I - Adriana Balthazar Md PhD, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The science of metaphysics teaches ancient spiritual knowledge. The starting point of true learning is trying to know our real selves, and this will eventually open doors to knowledge of God and the entire Creation. 
Our real constitution is multidimensional, consisting of different vibrational bodies from gross to subtle. In order to achieve the goal of spiritual growth, we must work on the purification and refinement of these bodies. In accordance with our way of living, the physical body may be coarse or refined in different degrees. 
Our work to purify the physical body encompasses paying careful attention to the following: 
What we eat
How we eat
Hygiene
Breathing
Speech and silence
Exposure to sunlight, pure air, and nature
Physical activities
How we spend physical energy
Rest, sleep, and moments of solitude
Sexual activity
Addictions
General attitude toward the physical body
The etheric body is the energy blueprint serving as a model for the building of the physical body. Each chakra in the etheric body represents a level of consciousness and has its own characteristics, correlations, and functions. Our work to purify and develop the etheric body involves the use of color and sound energies, essential oils and fragrances, energy and breathing exercises, hatha yoga, dream work, and meditation." />
