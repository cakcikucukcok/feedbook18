  <title>The Death of the Messiah and the Birth of the New Covenant: A (Not So) New Model of the Atonement - Michael J. Gorman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this groundbreaking book, Michael Gorman asks why there is no theory or model of the atonement called the new-covenant model, since this understanding of the atonement is likely the earliest in the Christian tradition, going back to Jesus himself. Gorman argues that most models of the atonement over-emphasize the penultimate purposes of Jesus&#39; death and the mechanics of the atonement, rather than its ultimate purpose: to create a transformed, Spirit-filled people of God. The New Testament&#39;s various atonement metaphors are part of a remarkably coherent picture of Jesus&#39; death as that which brings about the new covenant (and thus the new community) promised by the prophets, which is also the covenant of peace.  Gorman therefore proposes a new model of the atonement that is really not new at all--the new-covenant model. He argues that this is not merely an ancient model in need of rediscovery, but also a more comprehensive, integrated, participatory, communal, and missional model than any of the major models in the tradition. Life in this new covenant, Gorman argues, is a life of communal and individual participation in Jesus&#39; faithful, loving, peacemaking death.  Written for both academics and church leaders, this book will challenge all who read it to re-think and re-articulate the meaning of Christ&#39;s death for us." />
