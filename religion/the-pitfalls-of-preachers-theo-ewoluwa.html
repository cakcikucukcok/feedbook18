  <title>The Pitfalls of Preachers - Theo Ewoluwa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book will make you certain about what the Christian message is; and what it is not.
 It will bring home to you the Christian messengers often under-rated responsibilities and how to readily fall on their right side.
 You will acquire a rational approach to accomplishing your objective as a messenger of Christ through reading this book.
 This book will alert you to popular errors that are quietly creeping into even the most conservative church audiences.
 It will teach you how to classify your church, and therefore make you see the urgent spiritual remedies required. 
 You will understand the dynamics of how churches fare well or fail by the Lords biblically revealed yardstick.
 High-end spiritual poisons do take longer than one generation to gestate; so that the arrival of their ill-effects often take the new leaders in place by surprise. However, this book will show you a simple scriptural way to know spiritual poisons at first contact.
 Many books give dozens of steps to take in order to accomplish desirable objectives, but this one will avail you of simple, easy to remember, but often overlooked principles that will
save you from deadly and pervasive hazards of preachers." />
