  <title>Destiny Dynasty Legacy - Dr. James E. Randolph</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This Working Wealth Book (Working Wealth) is written out of my passion, concern and desire to see Gods people become more fully developed, purpose-driven and more effective in the Kingdom of God.  Our time is short and much must be done by the Body of Christ to make an impact and a difference on the earth.
I firmly believe that as believers and individuals we need more personal development and a real understanding of true wealth.  Wealth is not really about money, but rather the richness of our internal system which reveals who we are, our purpose in life, our gifts, talents, abilities and our God given assignment on earth.  A truly wealthy person is a valuable and powerful vessel that is internally opulent and abundantly blessed.  When we are wealthy we are overflowing with fulfillment, godly purpose, passion, delight and generosity.  Jesus is our ultimate example and He said in John 10:10bAMP, I came that they may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance,(to the full, till it over flows).  This is the true definition of wealth and we are assigned and entrusted to be examples of it.
In Working Wealth, you will learn all about wealth.  You will be given the resources to assist you in your personal development building so you can be a witness of Gods wealth.  Personal development is the key to becoming a truly wealthy individual with all fruitfulness, prosperity, success and effectiveness of a wealthy person.
Thank you for investing in yourself by purchasing the Working Wealth.  I can promise you that this book will be a very powerful tool and resource towards building a fulfilling, energizing, exciting and edifying lifestyle.  
I have found that every person wants to be better, more improved and more effective.  Personal development is the key to reaching those dreams, goals and desires that speak on the inside of you.  Why should you live in weakness and lack, when you are full of treasure?
Jesus said, in Matthew 25:14-15, For it is like a man who was about to take a long journey and he called his servants together and entrusted them with his property.  To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his own personal ability.  Then he departed and left the country.  Personal development is taking seriously what has been entrusted to you and investing in it to produce a wealthy, more profitable you." />
