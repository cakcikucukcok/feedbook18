  <title>Sixty Days of Grace - Dorothy Ruppert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In todays world, women desperately struggle to meet the unrealistic expectations of others and of themselves. Society tells women they can do it all, and yet they instinctively know they do not have the resources to accomplish all the demands placed upon them. Drawing on their own strength is not enough; in order to survive, women must draw on God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixty Days of Grace shares sixty stories from author Dorothy Ruppert, who has struggled through life and succeeded, only because of Gods grace. This grace is the prevalent theme of the Bible. From beginning to end, the accounts of the lives of biblical figures demonstrate His eternal grace. However, in modern society His grace is often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many challenges women face as daughters of the King living in a broken environment. Ruppert has been there, as mother, grandmother, working woman, and retiree. Thanks to His grace, she found her strength. All women can do the same, with the power of God. Its time to turn away from self-sufficiency and lean on Gods everlasting arm, because His grace is sufficient for the journey; His power is made perfect in human weakness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
