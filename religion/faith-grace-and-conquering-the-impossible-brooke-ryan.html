  <title>Faith, Grace, and Conquering the Impossible - Brooke Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Certainly, she must be crazy! I know they were thinking it. I stood there, cradling my newborn baby, and announced to my family and friends that I wanted to go to medical school. OK, so I have a babyand I am nineteenand I am not married. Cant there be a way to make this happen? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The baby changed everything, but they did not understand what that really meant to me. I am not sure I understood where that would lead me, but I knew that God had something in mind for me that I could not even begin to comprehend yet. He understood that I would need an incentive to find my full potential, and this would require digging through the mire of dysfunction that led me to this place. He would need to help me learn to truly forgive those who hurt me and to let the anger go. He would need to help me pick up the broken pieces in order for me to help others in their brokenness. He would have to remake me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the story of how the Lord brought me through growing up in a divided home plagued by domestic violence and fueled by my stepfathers binge alcoholism, how He brought me through single parenthood, and how He placed me on the road to achieving my elusive goal. The road was difficult, and complicated by lots of other annoying things, like three operations for cancer, and being hit by a car! However, nothing is impossible for God! Through faith, and by His Grace, He helped me to conquer the impossible!&lt;/p&gt;" />
