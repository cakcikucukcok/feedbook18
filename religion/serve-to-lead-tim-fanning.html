  <title>Serve to Lead - Tim Fanning</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I think that more often than not, when we search for answers to lifes little mysteries, we are looking in the wrong places. We seek insight from famous people, television shows, or radio personalities. Dont get me wrong; there are inspirational bursts from all these places. People rise from poverty, personal tragedy, or disabilities to achieve great success, and all of a sudden, their stardom makes us pay attention. Were they not the same people before they were famous? My point is that we are surrounded by these people every day, and for some reason, we dont see them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact of the matter is, just about everything that I have built my life on was so graciously given to me by people youve never heard of, and I would venture to say you never will. We are so consumed with what we are fed on social and mainstream media, we fail to realize we are walking in fields of gold every day surrounded by nuggets of life that can sustain you for all your days. All you have to do is pay attention, and the blueprint is there to follow. What am I talking about? I am talking about servants! They will teach you all you need to know, and there will be plenty leftover to teach others.&lt;/p&gt;" />
