  <title>Convictions, Dialects and Separations - Andrew Tyson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Convictions, Dialect and Separation: Communications of the Soul is about a
boy becoming a man in a world where he must conquer an internal darkness. He
ventures into death, ghost and the afterlife forming the foundation of an alternate
spiritual world from the other side. Caught in between two worlds, one white like
a canvas, the other black like receptive spirituality, the boy encounters the truths of
his past, present, and future. His soul learns how to sense these worlds for the first
time by crossing the unconscious darkness and finding the light.
When one boys purpose was empty, a hollow shell incased his thoughts, until he
found the self incarnate. Thus being an inhabitant of a soul, the body strives to
express its essence between the two opposing worlds realization and hope. The
higher truth struggles to set a tarnished soul free. Then, speech in the book is
intended to generate power for the other people in the world to wield their spiritual
sword of presence and strength. An underlying nature comes from his internal
communication with the divine source of clear consciousness and the universal
silence. Consciousness and self-actualization had no barriers and empowered levels
of thought, only to find purity and forgiveness.
The speculation of the worlds religious freedoms and the happenings of real time
have the chance to change everything. When heart is relinquished of all of its fears,
the soul will finally reside in a place of comfort inside of a now free body." />
