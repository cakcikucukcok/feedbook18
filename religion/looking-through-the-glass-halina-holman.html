  <title>Looking Through the Glass - Halina Holman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Windows, shadows and reflections have always fascinated me. We both look at windows, through them and past them. They bring light and a new vista but also allow us to peep at that which is beyond  the everyday and horizons yet unexplored. In playing my very small part in the shaping of the windows in the porch of Our Lady and St Thomas Church in Willington, Co. Durham., and the miracle of grace that a book by Sister Dorcy, which was the inspiration for the pictures, and fell into my hands, I entered into yet another journey. I pondered not just the mystery behind each picture but in the way they reveal the scene beyond. Beautifully etched, they take the eye and heart beyond the surface to the Altar and how Jesus is present to us today. 
Drawn to write on these I did so when a bout of serious illness visited me. This was a graced period for reflection. I pray the maybe a little sentence can bring a new light to that wonder that is our Mother who points to the source of all light Jesus HImself." />
