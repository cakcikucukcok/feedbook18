  <title>From My Mouth to God&#39;s Ear - Olanda Carr Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The pages of my book tell not only of my journey, but also of the journeys of those that have crossed my path along the road of life. Each poem presented tells a unique story --stories of great pain, suffering, and disappointment; stories of magnificent joy, peace, and triumph. I ask you to pause and reflect as you read each poem, and follow the road that has led me to where I am today.
Many of the poems included were written years ago and describe times that are no more. They were included for a specific reason: to help someone going through similar times today to find peace. Others were written quite recently and speak of modern-day events and challenges. It is my thought that others will find themselves embedded in these works as well. Some are quite personal and deal solely with my experiences, thoughts, beliefs, life, and times. Others are written through the eyes of those around me, as I allowed myself to craft words to imagine and describe the thoughts and feelings of others. All were written with great emotion, time, energy, and care. 
I pray that all poems touch readers in ways that bring peace and encourage love." />
