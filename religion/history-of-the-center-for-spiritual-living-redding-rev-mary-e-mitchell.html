  <title>History of the Center for Spiritual Living, Redding - Rev. Mary E. Mitchell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is not an ordinary book . . . it exists through grace. By the time I found the metaphysical teaching called Science of Mind in 1989, the local church had grown from a few people in a living room to about 175. Still meeting in an array of hotel ballrooms and clubs, the principles for successful living shared every Sunday were already deeply held beliefs in my life, so it immediately felt like home. One weekend we invited the elders of the church over to discuss church history and what a rich history it was. An afternoon with Bill and Win Siefert, Bruce and Dorothy Johnson, Marilyn and Joe Vondracek, Bob and Dorothy Huntoon, Harry and Frances Bleile, and Rev. James and Rev. Andrea Golden was magical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many ministers have taken their congregation skydiving? White water rafting? On wilderness treks? How many change lives through deep introspection at family retreats in rustic cabins deep in the woods? How many invite congregants and friends to pound thousands of nails for an old fashioned barn raising to build a sanctuary? Whether the name was the Science of Mind Center, Church of Religious Science, Spiritual Enrichment Center, or Center for Spiritual Living, over the years we all learned to jump into life in one new way or another. The list of events by year presented in the appendix creates a picture of a community that loves to laugh and play together, always mindful of doing their spiritual practices. What a life! What a community! What a history!&lt;/p&gt;
