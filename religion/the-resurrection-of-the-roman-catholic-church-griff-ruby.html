  <title>The Resurrection of the Roman Catholic Church - Griff Ruby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For nearly twenty centuries, the Roman Catholic Church withstood all the currents of change and history and maintained a closely guarded orthodoxy which has always served as the basis and center of all Christianity.  Yet, it is as if all of that has been just arbitrarily swept away in the few years since Vatican II.  Given what the Church has always taught about itself being indefectible, how could this have happened?  Did that Council have something to do with that terrible loss of faith?  Can the real Catholicism be found today, and if so, where?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shocking answer to this, once seen and truly understood, is as every bit as glorious as the original resurrection of Christ Himself, a tremendous source of faith and inspiration.  It is a broad-based, longstanding miracle passing right before our eyes, have we but the Grace to see it for what it is.&lt;/p&gt;" />
