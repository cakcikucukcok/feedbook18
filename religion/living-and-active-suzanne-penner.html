  <title>Living and Active - Suzanne Penner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p.Students carry a lot of heavy books around with them all day long and have limited time for lengthy reading outside of assigned course readings.  They use the latest technology as part of daily life and like to fill their empty time with information from technology.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;All in all, they need daily reminders and encouragement to follow Gods Word.  The Bible is always useful for current situations that college students face, so the focus of these devotionals is more useful to them than other, more generalized types of devotional readings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To emphasize the enduring truth of the Bible, devotional readings come from every book of both the Old and New Testaments.  The Bible is absolutely true, every part of it, every word of it.  An index of passages and an index of readings are appended at the back of the book to show the biblical emphasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devotional readings include the scripture passage, so that students need not carry a separate Bible with them in order to read the selection.  The readings are purposely kept short (300-500 words), so that students can gain the most from their available time.  Devotionals are meant to be thought-provoking and applicable to current college situations.&lt;/p&gt;" />
