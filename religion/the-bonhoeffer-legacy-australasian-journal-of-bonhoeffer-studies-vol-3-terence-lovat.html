  <title>The Bonhoeffer Legacy: Australasian Journal of Bonhoeffer Studies, Vol 3 - Terence Lovat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;SPAN STYLE= &quot;&quot; &gt;The Bonhoeffer Legacy: Australasian Journal of Bonhoeffer Studies is a fully refereed academic journal aimed principally at providing an outlet for an ever expanding Bonhoeffer scholarship in Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific region, as well as being open to article submissions from Bonhoeffer scholars throughout the world. It also aims to elicit and encourage future and ongoing scholarship in the field. The focus of the journal, captured in the notion of &amp;lsquo;Legacy&amp;rsquo;, is on any aspect of Bonhoeffer&amp;rsquo;s life, theology and political action that is relevant to his immense contribution to twentieth century events and scholarship. &amp;lsquo;Legacy&amp;rsquo; can be understood as including those events and ideas that contributed to Bonhoeffer&amp;rsquo;s own development, those that constituted his own context or those that have developed since his time as a result of his work. The editors encourage and welcome any scholarship that contributes to the journal&amp;rsquo;s aims. The journal also has book reviews.&lt;/SPAN&gt;" />
