  <title>Lessons That Inspire Us - Brother Julius Tate</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book has come through a great deal of pain and suffering. I had previously moved my membership from another congregation years earlier, and I became angry with the Lord. For one year, I did not attend any formal worship service; I began working with a outreach program, teaching and preaching at nursing homes here in Montgomery, Alabama, and during that time, I realized that I had more to offer God, and I slowly began to reconsider returning to a formal worship service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to stand and then confess my sins of not doing what I knew God wanted me to be doing, so a close brother of mine told me of a congregation that needed a Sunday school teacher. So I told my brother, Okay, lets make this happen. And that is when I became a member of the Northpointe Church of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;" />
