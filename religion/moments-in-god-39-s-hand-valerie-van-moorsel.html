  <title>Moments in God&#39;s Hand - Valerie Van Moorsel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are many opportunities to learn more about God and what it means to be a Christian. This journey has been blessed by many moments in the hand of God, learning, being chastised lifted up and to bridge the gap between learning and actually taking the wisdom and living each day for Him. We need to learn how to shine as a beacon of Gods ever burning light that is filtered through our lives into our neighbourhoods, churches, workplaces, and homes, spreading the truth of God everywhere we are. We need to confess that it is the truth of God that will release the freedom to go out into the entire world and proclaim His wonderful works, giving Him the praise and honour worthy of His Name.
This book is a compilation of daily devotions that is comprised of lessons that I has taken away from those devotions.  There has been many opportunities to take away a blessing from each meditation of Gods word.  During this time I was praying for God to show me my purpose, the reason why I was here.  God told me to write a book, using the devotions that I written out. So here is the final product of that endeavour. My hopes are that if you dont know my Saviour, you will and if you are discouraged that you be lifted up and blessed and refreshed, if you havent taken your faith to the limits my hopes are that you will. You will not be sorry." />
