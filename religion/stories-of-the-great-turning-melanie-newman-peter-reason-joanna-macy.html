  <title>Stories of the Great Turning - Melanie Newman, Peter Reason, Joanna Macy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book tells stories of how ordinary people in their everyday lives have responded to the challenges of living more sustainably. In these difficult times, we need stories that engage, enchant and inspire. Most of all, we need stories of practical changes, of community action, of changing hearts and minds.  This is a book that takes the question, &quot;What can I do?&quot; and sets out to find some answers using one of our species&#39; most vital skills: the ability to tell stories in which to spread knowledge, ideas, inspiration and hope.  Read about the transformation of wasteland and the installation of water power, stories about reducing consumption and creating sustainable business, stories from people changing how they live their lives and the inner transformations this demands." />
