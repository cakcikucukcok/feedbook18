  <title>The Leviathan Factor - Lawrence E. Burkholder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Leviathan Factor tells the incredible story of how Satan, created as Lucifer the morning star, self-transformed into Leviathan, God&#39;s serpentine arch foe. When he tried to achieve immortality by tweaking creation&#39;s lowest-level laws (a sophisticated computer/automaton) he created death instead. As the serpent he reappeared in the Genesis tree of good and evil, where he seduced humans to attempt immortality apart from covenant with God. Leviathan is responsible for the false belief that we each have an inner divine spark which, when reconnected to our ego, awakens our true inherent divinity. Unfortunately he and his demonic spirits also impact our minds, bodies, and environment as psi. A few of the many markers of these demonic psi are levitation, telepathy, telekinesis, deja vu, emotional oppressions, poltergeist activities, past lives&#39; &quot;memories,&quot; voices and visions, near death and out-of-body experiences, and trance channeling. Many of these psi phenomena are co-factors in mind disorders such as schizophrenia or epilepsy. Manifestations in Christian circles include false tongues and &quot;holy&quot; laughter. The Leviathan Factor is not a healing how-to. It is the first book to place demonic evil into the context of creation&#39;s basic structures and laws." />
