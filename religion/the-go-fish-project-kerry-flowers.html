  <title>The Go Fish Project - Kerry Flowers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new way to think about church, spiritual growth, and impacting our communities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus came to earth, the first thing he did was to command his disciples to follow him.  Make no mistake, Jesus knew that to transform the way people thought about God he had to have committed followers. So, while tending their nets, he said, Follow me, and Ill make you fishers of men.  He calls us to the same level of commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once they were his followers, Jesus took it a step further.  He wanted to see if following him expanded their faith.  So, as his followers stood before 5,000 hungry people on a remote mountainside, he said, You feed them.  He wants our actions to expand our faith as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a small group of people, completely following him in faith, Jesus changed history.  Why cant we do the same today?  The formula still works.  Follow him in faith.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go Fish Project aims to do just that by pulling together small groups to demonstrate Christs love in their community.  Church has never be so fun, so simple, and so meaningful!  By the time you finish this 40 day devotional guide, you will better understand what it means to follow in faith.  And if Go Fish becomes part of our DNA, we might just change the worldagain.&lt;/p&gt;" />
