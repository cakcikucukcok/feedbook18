  <title>The End and the Beginning: from Darkness to Light - James Edward L&#39; Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The End and The Beginning: From Darkness to Light is a dramatic portrayal of the Son of God, the Pioneer of our faith: JESUS as depicted in the four gospels. This is His story: a story that reaffirms our belief and faith in Him as our Savior. He Was a Galilean Jew and well-acquainted with Jewish law. His birth, ministry, death and resurrection serve as a basis of Gods continuing proclamation of joy and sadness, despair and hope, isolation and crowds and apparent defeat but in the end VICTORY! It is a story that never leaves us: a story that our parents, the sons and daughters of slaves, born of religious convictions and faith, shared with us during the days of our early youth amidst sweat, tears and a weary life. They referred to Him, both in song and thought as their Sweet Little Jesus Boy. This was the only thing that they truly could claim as their own. A CHILD A SON IS GIVEN UNTO YOU AS GOD HAD PROMISED!
