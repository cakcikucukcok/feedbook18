  <title>God’S Calling for an Investment - Dr. Willie J. Jones D.Th Dd. Pc.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God is Calling for an Investment, He has made an Investment in You. Know ye that the Lord He is God: it is He that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are His people, and the sheep of His pasture, (Psalm 100:3). He is the only one who knows the secret plan for His investment. Without God, there is no future investment, (Jeremiah 29:11).
Even the Gospel is an investment. It provides us with restoration and is preparing men and women of God to walk in ministry. The Gospel is also known as the Good News that brings hope and provides healing for the soul. Remember, the investor is God, and we are His investment.
Gods investment of the Gospel authenticates His power over the earth and mankind. Each investment God gives unto us is filled with miracles that demonstrate a heavenly illustration with an earthly manifestation. Gods investment here confirms His great power over the earth and mankind." />
