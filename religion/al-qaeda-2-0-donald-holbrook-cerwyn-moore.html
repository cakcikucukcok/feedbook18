  <title>Al-Qaeda 2.0 - Donald Holbrook, Cerwyn Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On 16 June 2011, three days before his sixtieth birthday, Ayman al-Zawahiri was declared the new leader of Al- Qaeda, replacing the fallen Osama bin Laden. The veteran Egyptian jihadist had little of his predecessor&#39;s charisma and enjoyed much less popularity, respect and celebrity. Yet, as scores of jihadi commanders from different organisations have succumbed to their enemies&#39; missiles, bombs and bullets, Zawahiri has soldiered on. His tenure as Al-Qaeda&#39;s leader has been marked by some of its darkest and most challenging moments, which have threatened the viability and future of Al-Qaeda&#39;s central leadership. The gravest such development has been the emergence of Islamic State as a separate and rival jihadist entity.
The best way to gauge Zawahiri&#39;s response to these threats is by studying the official statements and public communiqués that he has issued since taking the reins. This book provides the reader with professional translations of Zawahiri&#39;s key statements during his first five years as leader of Al-Qaeda. These official communications are introduced and contextualised to provide the reader with a comprehensive sourcebook, outlining the Al-Qaeda leadership&#39;s stance on the challenges to its existence since the death of bin Laden." />
