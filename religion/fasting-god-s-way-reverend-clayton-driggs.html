  <title>Fasting God’S Way - Reverend Clayton Driggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many Christians are unaware of what God expects from them when they fast. Many do not know the work that transpires when they fast and leave it up to chance, being uncertain that God will respond to them. Even more, many do not know what to expect from God after they fast, and so they overlook His blessed responses. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Fasting Gods Way, author and reverend Clayton Driggs shows us how God has given clear instructions about how we should fast-and why we should. The Bible reveals how God made fasting one of the most important things we should do, and Reverend Driggs explains that this is why a proper understanding of fasting should be restored in church congregations everywhere. Since fasting is a demonstration of love for God and others, we all should learn how to avoid illegitimate fasting and prepare our lives for fruitful, restorative fasts. By understanding the dos and donts of fasting-as well as the whys and hows-you will discover the keys to powerful and effective fasting. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
God has expectations of us when we fast, and if we meet these expectations, then we can look forward to results every time we fast. We must first truly understand how to fast Gods way, and know what to expect, then fasting can be a springboard to the many great exploits God desires to accomplish through us. So let Fasting Gods Way become a springboard for knowledge about fasting, and the start of a healthy fasting lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;" />
