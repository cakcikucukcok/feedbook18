  <title>Bible Commentary and Teachings - Cidi Mahammed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For we are royal priesthood, a peculiar people and that to show forth the praises of him, that hath call us out of darkness in to his marvelous light. 
As such, we are sons and daughters of the Lord our God, the eternal heavenly king. In this regard, it is gracious to be in honour of the salvation of the Lord our God who dwells eternally. 
Children should delight in sharing the testimony and word of the Lord, so as making the light of the Lord to show proof in our locality and region. 
We know that the word of the Lord hath shown light to us. That we all descended from Adam and Eve, and that through the word of the Lord, we all become children of Abraham in Christ the Lord. 
This testimony of the word of the Lord makes known through the gospel and in the ministry of apostles of the Lord our Saviour Christ. 
So in essence, we children in the Lord should aspire to share this testimony in the word of the Lord, so as to draw more others to come to light in to this testimony of the Lord, shed through in the word of the Lord. 
Thus in regard, I have taken this initiative in producing this booklet, Bible Commentary and Teachings, to share some testimony in to the word of the Lord and draw some light in to the word of the Lord. 
This is so that we can delight for more passion and aspiration to learn of the doctrine of our Lord Christ and God the Father. 
The commentary can lead us to make way for a grasp look in to the word of the Lord so that well be in place to take a quick note of the lessons of the Lord. 
The teachings would make us edified in the word of the Lord and lead us in forbearance in the Lord." />
