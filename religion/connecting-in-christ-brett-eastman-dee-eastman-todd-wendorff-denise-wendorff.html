  <title>Connecting in Christ - Brett Eastman, Dee Eastman, Todd Wendorff, Denise Wendorff...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fellowship.  The word gets used a lot in church.  But too often our understanding and practice of fellowship are shallow and stripped of the life-giving, life-transforming power God intended community to have.  Jesus lived out and taught a deeper, more radical kind of fellowship—a way of interacting that makes others sit up and take notice.  These six sessions will show you Jesus’ way of loving others “as I have loved you.”Experiencing Christ Together helps your group explore the five biblical purposes that make up a high-impact Christian life —fellowship, discipleship, ministry, evangelism, and worship.  Jesus perfectly lived out God’s purposes for his life, and he taught his followers how to do the same.  As you walk in the footsteps of those first disciples listening to and watching Jesus through these studies, you and your group will be transformed.  One small group leader put it this way:  “The Experiencing Christ Together series has motivated me more than any other Bible study that I have ever been to.  This Bible study gets to the heart of the matter—my character in Christ—and that has created action on my part.”" />
