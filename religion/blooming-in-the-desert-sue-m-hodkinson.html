  <title>Blooming in the Desert - Sue M. Hodkinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ecclesiastes 3:1 speaks of a time for everything and a season for every activity under heaven. I believe now is the time to make every effort to obtain the prize for which we have been chosen. Ephesians 1:8 instructs: The eyes of our hearts may be enlightened in order that we may know the hope to which God has called each one. However, we must draw from the well that God has provided and learn the way. Blooming in the Desert sets your place at the banquet table of God, where all treasure of wisdom and knowledge is being served. Each teaching is a collection of Gods bountiful and endless truths. Throughout the pages our Heavenly Father draws close, bearing gifts, a song of love, and a platform in our desert experience to share the expressions of His heart. Blooming in the Desert will enlighten your eyes to understanding. It will build you up in the face of hardship so that you no longer remain a child, but become a Son! Each chapter encourages us to pursue new endeavors. With participation, you may find God at the helm of your ship, doing what He does best! Blooming in the Desert supports the long and winding roadlong because it seems to take forever to get there, and winding because of the pitfalls and complexities we must all face when achieving a higher way. Whether you travel the longest yard or climb the highest crest; Blooming in the Desert is a life-development collection meant to dress and equip each person with a coat of arms and ignite each truth at your fingertips while you grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;" />
