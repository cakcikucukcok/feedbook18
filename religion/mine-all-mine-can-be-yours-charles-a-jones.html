  <title>Mine All Mine Can Be Yours - Charles A. Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is the source of this project?
I am certain this project of mine Mine All Mine / Can Be Yours: will make an
example for all walks of life. Whether you are pursuing a career, a goal or just living
day by day, the purpose of this project is the same. I suggest that you love, live and
pursue your life with the love of the Lord Jesus Christ.
Remember this, God sent his only begotten Son to die for our habits in life; that we
can arrive through the blood he shed on the hills of Calvary. So, my friend, whatever
you think you know or dont know, try Him because of that.
I tried Him and have realized that He is real, and God is real. I know and you know
that we cant live without Him. Whether you like it or not, you cant. So, stop faking
God and yourself.
Be honest in what you do. Remember always, for your sake, dont block Him out of
your life. Okay?
Remember this also, God has not forgotten you, hold your head up high and be true
to Him and Hell open doors to your heart. We are human beings and there is such
a thing as trying with Gods help always whether its right or wrong. He wont let you
fall any further then your bending your knees to pray, my child. Hell understand.
Jesus Christ was a man of goodness; He was sent to mend examples of our sin sick
souls. So behave and have faith. Let Jesus Christ rest within your heart, and trust
and obey His commandments.
For this is the will of God Almighty above all things. Amen." />
