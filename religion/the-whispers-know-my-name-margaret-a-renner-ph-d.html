  <title>The Whispers Know My Name - Margaret A. Renner Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From her early childhood episodes to her most recent encounters, she depicts how the &lt;i&gt;Whispers&lt;/i&gt; have provided inspiration, insight, strength, and courage as she attempts to shape her existence. The text provides not only a step-by-step process but memoirs that allow the process and application to unfold as historic events. The authors purpose is to leave a legacy of wonder about how these historic events establish, maintain, and sustain an on-going dialectic which ultimately determines ones destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This text is the completion of a trilogy. The author revisits the substance of the dialectic in the prior texts so there is no need to have read those texts to follow the process, events, and outcomes depicted in the text. The &lt;i&gt;Whispers&lt;/i&gt; were introduced in the first text, &lt;i&gt;Called by Many Names&lt;/i&gt;. The nature of the conversation involves mental discourse, listening, reflection and contemplation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many, her relationship with the &lt;i&gt;Whispers&lt;/i&gt; may appear to be &lt;i&gt;unique&lt;/i&gt;, but what makes this text &lt;i&gt;unique&lt;/i&gt; is the way and means used by the author to present her experiences. She glides effortlessly through the literary elements and genre styles, as she captures ones interest.&lt;/p&gt;" />
