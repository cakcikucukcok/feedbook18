  <title>The Gospel of Our Grandfathers - J. A. White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With so many versions of the gospel being marketed to the public, which message is correct? Why do so many professing Christians not know the essential elements of the message that Paul deemed to be the very power of God for salvation (Romans 1:16)? 
The Gospel of Our Grandfathers offers a theologically deep yet understandable overview of the glorious gospel that was once for all delivered to the saints (Jude 3). Ideal for small group study, personal devotion, evangelism, or new member instruction, this study explores the gospel in five sections:
The Attributes of God
The Depravity of Fallen Man
The Substitutionary Atonement of Christ
Mans ResponseRepentance and Faith
Assurance of Salvation 
The Gospel of Our Grandfathers is a simple work that seeks to bring you face-to-face with the attributes of God, the plight of man, the excellence and sufficiency of Christ, the application of redemption, and the assurance of salvation. Whether you are a seasoned follower of Christ, a new Christian, or a curious skeptic, you will find in this account a clear, biblically saturated presentation of the message that men of old have proclaimed and men of valor are called to proclaim still. 
J. A. White lists the facts of the gospel of Jesus Christ and shows his reader that, in short, this is your fathers and grandfathers religion.
Rick Walston, PhD, President of Columbia Evangelical Seminary
A clear and faithful presentation of the gospel of Jesus Christ, once delivered to the saints! The Gospel of Our Grandfathers will deepen your understanding and encourage your soul.
Greg Gilbert, author of What Is the Gospel? and pastor of Third Avenue Baptist Church in Louisville, KY.
In The Gospel of Our Grandfathers, John White points the readers gaze to the God of the gospel, portraying the various facets of His character and His work for the salvation of sinners through Jesus Christ.  Amply supported by Scripture and expanded upon by gospel sages past and present, the thoughts John shares in this warm-hearted book will enrich your love for Christ, deepen your appreciation for the Faith once-delivered to the saints, and equip you to deliver the gospel to the next generation with clarity and depth. This present generation, and the generations to come, are well served by this resource!
