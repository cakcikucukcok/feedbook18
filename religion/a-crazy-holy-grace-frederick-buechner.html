  <title>A Crazy, Holy Grace - Frederick Buechner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When pain is real, why is God silent?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frederick Buechner has grappled with the nature of pain, grief, and grace ever since his father committed suicide when Buechner was a young boy. He continued that search as a father when his daughter struggled with anorexia. In this essential collection of essays, including one never before published, Frederick Buechner finds that the God who might seem so silent is ever near. He writes about what it means to be a steward of our pain, and about this grace from God that seems arbitrary and yet draws us to his holiness and care. Finally he writes about the magic of memory and how it can close up the old wounds with the memories of past goodnesses and graces from God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here now are the best of Buechner&amp;rsquo;s writings on pain and loss, covering such topics as the power of hidden secrets, loss of a dearly beloved, letting go, resurrection from the ruins, peace, and listening for the quiet voice of God. And he reveals that pain and sorrow can be a treasure&amp;mdash;an amazing grace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buechner says that loss will come to all of us, but he writes that we are not alone. Crazy and unreal as it may sometimes seem, God&amp;rsquo;s holy, healing grace is always present and available if we are still enough to receive it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
