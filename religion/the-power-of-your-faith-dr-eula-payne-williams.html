  <title>The Power of Your Faith - Dr. Eula Payne-Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My doctor with that somewhat soft voice and that I hate this part of my job attitude says to me Im so sorry Eula, but you are paralyzed and will have to be in a wheelchair the rest of your life. How does a young woman in her middle twenties react to this type of news?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was now time for me to draw on everything that I had been taught or had caught concerning faith in God. Will I accept the wheelchair or will the POWER OF MY FAITH cause me to defy it and walk away! Which will it be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered; what is faith? Will it work? Does it work? How do you get it? I have heard about it; but how can I really achieve it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you read this book it is my prayer that your faith will be increased and you will never doubt whether it works again. It is not what others believe but what do you believe? Because it really is THE POWER OF YOUR FAITH!&lt;/p&gt;" />
