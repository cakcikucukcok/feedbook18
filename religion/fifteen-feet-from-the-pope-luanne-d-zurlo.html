      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In early 2013, Luanne Zurlo decided to take an extended break from years of intense, travel-heavy work that had left her exhausted. Three months later during a brief vacation in Rome, Zurlo felt a pull like never before. It became obvious to her that she needed to spend more time in Romespecifically to study theology at the Angelicum, a Pontifical University. Some six months later, a unique journey began as Zurlo returned to Italy to fulfill her dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her travel journal compiled in the form of dispatches, Zurlo shares a thoughtful, often amusing view of her four-month sabbatical overseas as she immersed herself in the culture of Rome, learned how to climb the seventy-three steps to her apartment without gasping for air, explored Italy, including a search for a family saint, and soaked up an array of experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen Feet from the Pope shares fascinating commentary and photographs from a former Wall Street analysts unforgettable experiences during her Roman sabbatical.&lt;/p&gt;" />
