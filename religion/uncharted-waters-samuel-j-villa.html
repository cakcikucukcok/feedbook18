  <title>Uncharted Waters - Samuel J. Villa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God wants to speak to us &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In life, sometimes things arent as they seem. The harbor looks so peaceful, so comfortable, but is it? We search for satisfaction anchored in the harbor, but God has called us for a life of bold adventure out in the uncharted waters. In opposition, the world distracts us with the illusion that material possessions, prestigious titles, and superficial beauty will deliver satisfaction. This distraction creates an insatiable thirst for peace that cant be quenched without a close relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we leave the seemingly safe confines of the harbor and explore the deep, life-giving waters, we find truth and fulfillment of our identities in Him. Reducing the distractions of our busy lives, while connecting with God and other believers in community, will transform and transport us to our God-given destinations. These revelations provide us the peace we have been seeking all along. Are you ready to answer the call?&lt;/p&gt;" />
