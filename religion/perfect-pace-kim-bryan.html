  <title>Perfect Pace - Kim Bryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you crave peace and joy in your life? &lt;br /&gt;
 Do you want to be happy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We all desire these things, but many of us are too busy, too self-absorbed, or too imprisoned by the way that we have always operated to take the steps required to change our lives and to allow Gods peace and joy to flow into our everyday living. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admit that I have been guilty of settling for less than Gods best plan for my walk with Him. At one time, I actually took pride in considering myself to be someone who was in control of my life. Then God taught me a lesson about surrendering to Him and to His will for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfect Pace gives you all of the details of the powerful surrender lesson that God revealed to me during a walk with our dog, Shane. The day God showed me the parallels between a walk with Shane and my walk with Him was life-changing. Since that day, I have not been able to look at either walk in the same way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every one of us is offered the opportunity to walk with God at His perfect pace in perfect peace.&lt;/p&gt;" />
