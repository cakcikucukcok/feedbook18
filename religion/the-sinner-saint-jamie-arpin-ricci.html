  <title>The Sinner Saint - Jamie Arpin-Ricci</title>
      <meta name="description" content="“You see, my son, the saints are not so different than you or me. Their stories reveal them to be very much human. However, this frailty does not weaken their witness or holiness, but rather extends to us the invitation to the same life amidst our own frailty.” From the 1st Chapter
Many of us think of Patrick as the beloved Celtic leader - a super human saint, who was blessed with a desire to do great things for God.
But here Jamie Arpin-Ricci writes a fresh and informative telling of the story of his early life when he came to terms with his own humanity. He was captured by the Irish, forced to be a slave, and made to live and work for years in isolation and lonely suffering.
Patrick experienced transformation over many, many years as he came to the end of himself and surrendered to God. Only then did he had the strength and faith to build his life into a mission of grace, forgiveness and discipleship." />
