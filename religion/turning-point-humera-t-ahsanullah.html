  <title>Turning Point - Humera T. Ahsanullah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="?
It is the desire   in a person that makes one seek the truth. And it is the silent whispers of the heart that stirs those desires to take the courageous path. Like the whispers of my heart to have my independent thinking, to examine everything. Like the yearning in me to find out why I exist and what really is the concept of God. This, led me to embark on my journey of discovery, I was ready to take on the challenge. 
Like me, every one of us desires to know the answers to the meaning of their lives and beliefs. Few gather the courage to walk this road. Fear of what they might discover at the Turning Point of the road grips them, fear of losing the comfort zone they possess shatters them and fear of being alone in the end terrifies them. So they shun their desire for truth and subdue their courage for questioning and challenging. 
What Turning Point has to offer is only for those who are ready to meet their fears, take the challenge and find the answers. If our Creator is the truth, our puny challenges and questions can do no harm to its existence.  
Are you ready?" />
