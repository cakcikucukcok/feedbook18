&lt;p&gt;Do you ever eat something yummy in a hurry and then forget how good it tasted? Do you feel hungry shortly thereafter, as if you had not eaten? If you ever reach for something quick and &quot;comforting,&quot; and yet dont feel full or satisfied, perhaps what you really want is to be nourished. And nourishment goes way beyond food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of life&#39;s most comforting foods is soup, and you hold in your hands a very special recipe. This particular formula of Vitamin Soup, with all of life&#39;s &quot;vitamins&quot; from &quot;Attitude&quot; to &quot;Zest for Life,&quot; is an A-Z list of supplements that has everything to do with how you nourish yourselfphysically, mentally, emotionally, and spirituallyand little to do with food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indulging in these vitamins is easy, and there is something for everyone: a recipe for balanced, healthy living; simple instructions for reducing stress; proven techniques for increasing energy; and even, as a potential side benefit, methods for releasing weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sally Galloway, a natural health coach for almost thirty years, has cooked up a whimsical and clever collection of ideas and &quot;recipes&quot; for you to spend time with family and friends (Vitamin F), improve your love life and finances (Vitamins K and M), and live with more vibrancy (Vitamin V).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These recipes for success will take you out of the kitchen and open your eyes to the people, places, and experiences where you can find true nourishment for your mind, body, and soul.&lt;/p&gt;" />
