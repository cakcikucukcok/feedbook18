  <title>From Thunder to the Throne Room and God’S Amazing Grace. - Norma Blackmon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Bible Study through Hebrews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! What an amazing book of the Bible!   All of Gods word is so pertinent to our lives today. It provides strength, courage, and hope. It also offers correction and edification that in our present time we would be able to stand, complete and fully equipped. Gods word keeps us ever mindful of His majesty, His sovereignty, and His incredible grace as He ever faithfully meets with, leads, and provides for His people. The book of Hebrews is such a powerful message of Gods truths and His eternal plan of redemption for a lost peopleyou and I. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only are we blessed with amazing understanding as we delve into such wonderful questions such as: Who are angels? By what order was Jesus called High Priest? What is the difference between the priestly order under the law verses Melchizedek? What six elementary principles does the author have us address and why? And can you lose your salvation? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is so much to learn from Hebrews, and I assure you I could not begin to touch a fraction of it. Yet my prayer, my hope, is that after you have turned these pages, you too will be assured of Gods beautiful promise, His unfailing love, and His perfect plan for us, His children.&lt;/p&gt;" />
