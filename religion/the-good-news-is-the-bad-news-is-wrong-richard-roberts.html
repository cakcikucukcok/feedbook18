  <title>The Good News Is The Bad News Is Wrong! - Richard Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How do you react when bad news visits your door? What happens when you are suddenly blind-sided and your life is being ravaged by a deadly, incurable disease? What do you do when it looks like your business is going down the tubes and you&amp;#39;re about to lose everything financially? Where do you turn when you&amp;#39;ve just received the shocking news that your son or daughter is hooked on drugs or alcohol? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does God have a miracle when bad news strikes?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the society in which we live, where we watch news on television or the internet 24/7, is it possible to believe that the bad news is wrong?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I say a resounding, YES! And I&amp;#39;ve written this book to let you know that even if it looks like you&amp;#39;re going under, and you&amp;#39;re about to be engulfed in the roaring waves of the sea, Jesus Christ declared, &amp;quot;Let us go over unto the other side.&amp;quot; The devil may be in the storm business, but Jesus is still in the going-over business. The Bible, God&amp;#39;s Word, is still the same Good News message that it was two thousand years ago. And the good news is the bad news is wrong!&lt;br&gt;" />
