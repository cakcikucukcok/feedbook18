  <title>God Saved Me - Wylie Comp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;God Saved Me&lt;/em&gt; is written to encourage believers to be aware of their position in Christ and be willing to prepare their minds and hearts for the challenges ahead. Then, believers should be available to participate in sharing the good news whenever and with whomever God gives the opportunity. &lt;em&gt;God Saved Me&lt;/em&gt; addresses critical concerns for outreach and witnessing, focusing on the local churchs responsibility; the importance of prayer in witnessing; reliance on the Word of God; dealing with fear and guilt; being approved as a person of faith; making Christ the topic; and development of a personal testimony that can be shared repeatedly. This book speaks directly to the need for believers to come together in support of one another and make a commitment to follow Christs directive to make disciples wherever an opportunity is presented. Using anecdotal comments and personal accounts of outreach, &lt;em&gt;God Saved Me&lt;/em&gt; provides fresh insight to help believers respond to the need for people of faith to get in the fight for the souls of their families, friends, and loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rev. Wylie Comp has written one of the most comprehensive books on the subject of Christian witnessing that I have ever had the privilege of reading or reviewing.&lt;/em&gt; God Saved Me &lt;em&gt;is written on a level that anyone can understand and use as a guide for becoming an effective Christian soldier in the army of God.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
