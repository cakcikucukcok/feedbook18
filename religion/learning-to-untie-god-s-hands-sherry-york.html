      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When you are facing the troubles and pains of everyday life, do you feel that, instead of overcoming them, they are overcoming you? Are you letting your troubles get the best of you instead of seeking Gods help to deal with your challenges? As Christians, we must learn to turn to God for help in dealing with and ultimately resolving our problems. &lt;em&gt;In Learning to Untie Gods Hands&lt;/em&gt; author Sherry York talks about the need for us to be able to understand what it takes to overcome the difficulties in our lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The negative behaviors we sometimes use in dealing with those troublessuch as bitterness, jealousy, and the inability to forgive ourselves and otherscan keep God from working in our lives. York offers seven steps that can turn your life around just as it did for her. It is her belief that God wants to give us the things we will need to fight our enemy the devil, but first we must untie Gods hands so that he can do His work with us. In order to untie Gods hands, however, you must first be in Gods hands. The most important step in untying Gods hands is that you must be born again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;By following these seven steps and becoming a willing, obedient vessel, you can have the opportunity to experience Gods love, help, and understanding in your life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
