  <title>Cultural Tools for Interpreting the Good News - John J. Pilch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can reading the Bible in its appropriate Mediterranean cultural context shed light on concerns of believers who live in Western or other cultures? In &lt;I&gt;Cultural Tools for Interpreting the Good News&lt;/I&gt;, John J. Pilch presents a basic introduction to the ancient Middle Eastern culture in which the Bible originated. A brief review of the life of Jesus from birth to death and resurrection guides the selection of biblical text segments to illustrate key cultural concepts so that believers may appropriate the Bible for personal or community life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapter one examines the core Middle Eastern cultural concepts honor and shame as they are reflected in the stories about Jesus&#39; origins and his behavior in adulthood. Chapter two describes how Jesus grew up to become a typical and successful male in his culture. Chapter three presents Jesus as a Holy Man in his tradition who announces the reign of God especially in parables. Chapter four shows how Jesus sought to establish the reign of God especially in his healing activities and by offering fresh insights into the appearances of the Risen Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapters are Honor and Shame,&quot;  *How a Mediterranean Boy Becomes a Man, -   *Jesus Announces the Reign of God, -   *Jesus Seeks to Establish the Reign of God. -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;John J.
