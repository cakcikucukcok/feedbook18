  <title>Everything but Satisfied - Dr. Cathy R. Owens-Oliver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Youve been told that your husband is coming around the corner, but you cant figure out which corner that is. It seems your man is nowhere to be found, and you are still single. It is God who said being alone is not a good thing. And yet clearly you are alone. If God, back in the Garden of Eden, saw and knew that being alone is not good, why did he allow it? Why would God create or cause anything that is not good? Perhaps it is because God is up to something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sooner you align your desires with his, the sooner you will understand what he is up to and why your request to be married, among other things, is still in his inbox. The first thing you must understand is that the whole time youve been trying to get something from God, God has been trying to get something from you. Have you ever stopped to think about why you are single and what God may want you to do? There may be something that God has called you to do as a single woman that you must complete before you get married.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book will help you realize that marriage is not the big picture; its just one piece of the puzzle. God has so much more in store for you. But between now, when you want it, and then, when you get it, God has set in motion a divine plan for your future. The more time you spend with him, the better prepared you will be for all the wonderful experiences the future holds, marriage included. This book will help you recognize and fill in some of the missing pieces in your life so that when you do get married, youll be ready for the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;" />
