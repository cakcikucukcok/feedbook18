  <title>Establishing a Healthy Church - Madison Clark Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is written to help believers know they can be spiritually healthy and bring spiritual health to their local church bodies.  It&#39;s not an attempt to present anything new or to discredit any spiritual thoughts or views. It will help Christians better manage what Jesus has already established - His church.  Jesus says, &quot;upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it&quot;(Matthew 16:18). This is the  assurance that the founder, foundation, formation, fellowship, future, and function of the church are right. However, members the body of Christ must have spiritual checkups by the power of the Holy Spirit, in order to keep themselves healthy for Christ.
Its design is to assure Christians that they are following the divine mandates set by Jesus by bringing them into view of the spiritual and physical works of the church. It will resurrect Gospel Communication and Love, which many believers have allowed to remain dormant. It challenges people to open their hearts and mind to the Holy Spirit as He attempts to guide them into all truths through transformation, unity, and true
spirituality. It will help women in the church discover their identities rather than search for their roles as they follow God&#39;s word more closely.  It also helps believers depend on the resurrected Christ for their assurance. This book enhances (Jesus), but it helps us see the whole picture of the church and not just a few personal, isolated, individual views, trying to make sense. It will help settle doctrinal disputes and assist in church discipline.  There are many ways spiritual health can be maintained in the church. I have pinpointed only a few to inspire believers to bring spiritual health to your life, the church and the lives of people everywhere." />
