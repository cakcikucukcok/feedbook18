  <title>The Unintentional Medium - Suzi Samuel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When the boundaries between the real world and the unseen world overlap and you begin getting cooking tips and dating advice from your ghostly grannies, life itself can never be the same. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you do when you suddenly realise that there is a whole other world out there which is opening up to you? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You ride the whirlwind, hang on tight and enjoy this whole new adventure of being an Unintentional Medium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a story of an adventure, a step into the unknown, a collision of worlds and what happens to the unsuspecting young woman who happens to have been chosen by the spirit world to act as their messenger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The true story leads us through an eventful and often hilarious life describing events and people, both here and in the spirit world who have played such a part in this journey.  A newly single girl on the London dating scene and who, after several close escapes, finally finds happiness with her handsome Australian husband.  Not only are the spirits extremely happy about this, they redouble their efforts to get their message across and pop in with increasing regularity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cross between Bill Bryson, Brigit Jones and Ghost with a dash of Carrie Bradshaw thrown in for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;" />
