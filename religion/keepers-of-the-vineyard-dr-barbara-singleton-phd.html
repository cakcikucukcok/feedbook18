  <title>Keepers of the Vineyard - Dr. Barbara Singleton, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This study guide is intended to be a guide for individuals who desire to learn more about missionary work. It does not aim to cover every subject concerning the missionary and his mission, but rather to set forth in an abridged form a working knowledge of the missionary and his duty to win souls for the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus commanded his disciples to go into the world to preach the gospel to every creature (Mark 16:15). A missionary is one of the tools that God uses to evangelize the world. God realizes that, in addition to knowledge, other qualities are necessary for a missionary to become successful on the missionary field. Some of these qualities are less tangible but must exist concurrently for an individual to achieve that success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missionaries are reflections of Jesus Christ; when others see them, they see what they ought to be. God has set missionaries in the church for the purpose of picking up the pieces of weak and shattered lives and putting them back together again (Acts 13:47).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study guide, I will introduce you to the life of a missionary as it relates to his purpose, place, position, and work in the church and the community. It is my desire that this manual will be a blessing to all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
