  <title>The Revelation of a Mystery - Dr. Frances Wright-Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Revelation of a Mystery is a text and workbook that teaches the relevance of the book of Romans to life today. The epistle of Romans is the most comprehensive teaching of Christian doctrine. To everyone who thinks the Bible is outdated, the Holy Scriptures are just as relevant today as they were when God first gave them to mankind. While our means of travel, way of living, and technology changes, human nature does not change. Murder is still murder, stealing is still stealing, lying is still lying, and sexual immorality is still sexual immorality. Our society has disregarded this fact; therefore, it has been plagued by social ills that have been leading us down destructive paths and bringing us sexually transmitted diseases, HIV and AIDS, abortion, greed, hatred, and violence. The only way to overcome these social ills and live a life of victory is through the Lord Jesus Christ and His teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Apostle Paul was Gods chosen vessel to bring to the world a written record of His plan of salvation for the world. When the Apostle finished this epistle he ended it with this verse: Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began  (Romans 16:25 KJV). Gods plan of salvation for the world is fully revealed. The Old Testament prophets taught it, the Lord Jesus Christ brought it, and the Holy Spirit is sent to complete it.&lt;/p&gt;
Justification by faith in the Messiah
Salvation and its benefits
The outpouring of the Holy Spirit
Empowered to walk in the Spirit
Victory over sinful flesh and death" />
