From that point on, his life has been a journey of investigation into the spirit world. Along the way, he learned many secrets about not only spirits but also the living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In&lt;i&gt; Where Do You Walk? &lt;/i&gt;Dube shares narratives and insights from his lifelong connection and work with the paranormala gift given to him by the great white light of Christ.
