  <title>Love: An Essential Journey, An Essential Proof - Mr. Larry Cochran MBA</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What does this kind of love look like? We can say what Jesus said &quot;greater love has no man than this than to lay down his life for a friend&quot;.  Paul echoes this kind of love when he was exhorting husbands to &quot;love their wives as Christ loved the Church&quot;.  Now there are all kinds of arguments as to the different types of love such as phileo which is brotherly, eros which is erotic, agape which is godly, and storge which is devotional. I don&#39;t want to beat that horse on this one. I am not trying to give a long discourse on what love actually means, I simply want to explore what love really is and how it can be practical to the Christian life at all times and at all levels. As with other writings that I have this book is a journey that I want to take the readers on with me as I look to define in a clear way &quot;Love&quot;." />
