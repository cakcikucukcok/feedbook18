  <title>Finding Your Way - the Secret to Finding and Creating Your Purpose - Kaneen Morgan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Finding Your Way is a book of spiritual rediscovery which inspires and shows you how to discover and achieve your greatest asset and then contribute it to the world. This empowering book will affect anyone seriously interested in changing their lives, discovering their strengths, attacking what prohibits them from moving forward, improving their thinking, career and financial status, and most importantly their faith in God. 
I was inspired to write this book because I have suffered crises and in faith. I claimed to have faith in God, yet made the wrong decisions, lacked the proper direction, and experienced homelessness and lack which resulted in mistakenly feeling abandoned by God. Why do many believers experience disruptions, setbacks, and a lack of vision - the vision set forth by God for us? Some are suffering in the lack of spiritual awareness, wisdom, patience, mentorship, and true faith in God. Finally I found my way. This book takes the reader into a journey of the self, knowing God, and learning to recognize His voice. What does it mean to be faithful to God&#39;s word while developing spiritual maturity, spiritual leadership, and spiritual entrepreneurship? Through lessons learned, &quot;Finding Your Way,&quot; offers a spiritual, inspiring, and personal application of receiving God&#39;s favor and abundance. This book is intended for Spiritual Leaders, Christian Entrepreneurs, believers in Christ, and those who are transitioning in their careers, and lives." />
