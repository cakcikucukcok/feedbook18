  <title>Walk with Me - Dennis E. Coates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Just as Jesus spoke to the two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so too will He speak personally to the reader as he or she walks with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Walk With Me&lt;/em&gt;, Jesus says, Let me take you to that moment when I will enter your heart. To walk with Jesus, to be with Him, to listen to Him, to hear Him, makes it possible to become more like Him so that little by little our hearts and minds reflect Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to let you know who you are to Me and to My Father. And to tell you that We need you. To you, beloved one, God gives His life and calls you into His very life. Come and see how our life together grows from simply being together each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has His perfect plan for each of us; each of us is completely in His mind, and His will for each is perfect. The way of Jesus is the holy way, the wonder-filled way, the way that bears much fruit in our life and in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Friend who, through our friendship, will bring you further into eternal life. It is the life He alone brings and nourishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give Him that moment to be with Him, to listen to Him, to &lt;em&gt;hear&lt;/em&gt; Him, to let Him touch your life, and to let Him lead you. (233 words)&lt;/p&gt;" />
