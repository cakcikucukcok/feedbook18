  <title>REVELATION A Love Story: The Hero - His Bride - Her Rescue - Monica Bennett-Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Written to be a blessing, th&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Book of Revelation has a hero, a damsel in distress, a villain and a plot!&amp;nbsp; When we don&amp;rsquo;t &amp;lsquo;add&amp;rsquo; anything or &amp;lsquo;take&amp;rsquo; anything away, the plot becomes easy to see.&amp;nbsp; It reads like this&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A brave royal hero rescues his princess from the clutches of a villain and places her into the hands of seven of his most trusted guardians, then returns home to report his victory to his father, the King.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On his return his father rewards his son&amp;rsquo;s bravery by giving him the kingdom and commissions him to rid their kingdom of the villain forever. The newly crowned young king immediately sets out to vanquish a dragon, two beasts, three frog kings and a wicked queen.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After his final victory he collects his lovely princess and takes her back to his kingdom to meet his father. During the ensuing celebrations the valiant royal marries his beloved and takes her to his bejewelled palace, where they both live happily ever after.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It sounds like a fairytale, but it&amp;rsquo;s not a fairytale.&amp;nbsp; This is a true story!&amp;nbsp; This is the story of Salvation and the personal testimony of Jesus Christ.&amp;nbsp; This is the Book of Revelation...the greatest love story of all time!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Author Note: As I explain to you how I see Christ in the most wonderful last book of the Bible, it is my hope that you will fall in love with our heroic Lord all over again and see him the way he deserves to be seen; as the world&amp;rsquo;s only glorious and victorious Saviour.&lt;/p&gt;" />
