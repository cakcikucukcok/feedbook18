  <title>Is There Hope for the Christian Faith? - William Floyd Dopp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With a gentlemans questionIs there hope for the Christian faith?lingering in his thoughts, William Floyd Dopp began to discover its answer while visiting churches in Africa. His experience with the powerful and vibrant life of African Christians, especially in the Anglican churches in Uganda, contrasted sharply with the foundering and fading communities of Christians he encountered in Europe and North America.
Is There Hope for the Christian Faith?  shares the results of the authors grappling with this haunting and hopeful question. He tells how the church in Africa, epitomized by a church convention sign that proclaimed, Jesus is our living hope, provides a sense of promise to churches like one in London, where a brochure noted the churchs purpose: Preserving Holy Worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five hundred years after Martin Luther called for reform, a new call has led to the beginnings of another reform of the church. Is There Hope for the Christian Faith? looks at why the church faces so many challenges and explores the hope shown by mission-minded Christians, great Christian authors, and mission-driven ministries in Africa. Yes, there is hope. The sign in Africa says it allJesus is our living hope.&lt;/p&gt;" />
