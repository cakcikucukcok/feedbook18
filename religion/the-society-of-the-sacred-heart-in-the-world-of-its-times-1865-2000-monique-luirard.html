  <title>The Society of the Sacred Heart in the World of Its Times 1865 -2000 - Monique Luirard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After the death of its founder in 1865, the Society of the Sacred Heart experienced exceptional recruitment and expansion, and departure from France of more than 2500 religious at the beginning of the century. Its story is that of the thousands of women who joined it to root their lives in its charism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the forty countries where they have been sent, they have had to confront liberalism and anti-clericalism, revolution, the effects of Nazism and Marxism and world wars that destroyed their houses and scattered their members. 
After the Second Vatican Council, the elimination of cloister opened new fields of apostolic work to the Society. This book shows how the congregation developed amid internal crises, which did not differ from those in the Church and civil society, and how from these crises there emerged little by little a new way to be a Religious of the Sacred Heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
