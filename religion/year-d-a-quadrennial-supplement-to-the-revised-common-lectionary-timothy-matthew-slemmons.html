  <title>Year D: A Quadrennial Supplement to the Revised Common Lectionary - Timothy Matthew Slemmons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Although one often hears of the need to preach the whole counsel of God, few resources have seriously and specifically attempted to assist the preacher and planner of worship to do just that--until now. Year D makes the case for the need and promise of supplementing the Revised Common Lectionary with a fourth year of lections and arranges many previously excluded biblical texts in an orderly, one-year preaching plan. It fills a need widely voiced by preachers that the lectionary effectively limits and censors the functional canon of Scripture. Destined to serve as a staple source of significant revitalization in mainline preaching and worship, Year D banks on the agency of Word and Spirit to renew the church as few practical proposals have done in the last twenty years, lending new focus and impetus for exploring the Bible&#39;s forgotten riches. A timely and urgently needed return to the sources, Year D represents a fresh appropriation of neglected and marginalized texts for preaching, worship, education, and devotion, and thus constitutes a substantive, scriptural attempt to address what Walter Brueggemann has called the current preaching emergency." />
