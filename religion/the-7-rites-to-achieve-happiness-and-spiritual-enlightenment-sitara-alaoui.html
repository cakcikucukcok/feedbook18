  <title>The 7 Rites to Achieve Happiness and Spiritual Enlightenment - Sitara Alaoui</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In life, people will encounter ritesmoments of grace that lift ones consciousness out of the everyday mode. They create and hold something sacred. In relation to this, author Sitara shares The 7 Rites to Achieve Happiness and Spiritual Enlightenment, her new book released through Xlibris.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
All religions, whether they are ancient or new age religions, contain some sort of rites.  People who hold nothing sacred are lost.  Rites open the doorway into the internal reality of the universal imagination, where life is unlimited, spirit reigns and anything is possible. The 7 Rites that Sitara introduces will open the door to ones interior riches, where life pours itself from a limitless source.  Anything can be achieved through the use of this force.  Through this book, readers can learn The 7 Rites: 1) The Rite of Association; 2) The Rite of Cleansing; 3) The Rite of Luck; 4) The Rite of Love; 5) The Rite of Relationships; 6) The Rite of Wealth; and 7) The Rite of Pilgrimage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Following The 7 Rites to Achieve Happiness and Spiritual Enlightenment will allow the readers to channel the spiritual force they acquire to increase the presence of soul and happiness in this world and become enlightened.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The 7 Rites are not intended to replace the religions of the World, such as Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, or the Worship of Ancestors and Nature Spirits. They will only serve to enhance what the people already know, and if they possess a positive mental state when following these rites, they will achieve a great deal of happiness and will not feel alone in this World." />
