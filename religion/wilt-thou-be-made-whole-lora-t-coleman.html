If my people who are calledbyMy name will humble themselves, and pray, and seek My face, andturn from their wicked ways, I will hear from My heavenly father, and I will forgive their sins and heal their land.
2 Chronicles 7:14
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 
Romans 10:9-10
Then Peter said unto them: Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
Acts 2:38
Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
John 3:3
Now we know that God hearethnot sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth His will, him He heareth.
John 9:31
Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; for He is faithful that promised.
And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:
Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.
Hebrews 10:23-25" />
