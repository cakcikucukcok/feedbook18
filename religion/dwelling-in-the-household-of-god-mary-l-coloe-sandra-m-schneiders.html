  <title>Dwelling in the Household of God - Mary L. Coloe, Sandra  M. Schneiders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her remarkable first book, &lt;i&gt;God Dwells With Us: Temple Symbolism in the Fourth Gospel,&lt;/i&gt; Mary L. Coloe, P.B.V.M., explored the profound insight of John&#39;s Gospel expressed in Jesus &#39; invitation to his disciples: Make your home in me, as I make mine in you (John 15:4). For the gospel&#39;s author and audience, the dwelling of God among humans was, above al, the Jerusalem Temple. The gospel traces how &#39;after the trauma of the destruction of the Temple &#39;the Johannine community came to expand and deepen its knowledge of God&#39;s dwelling among humans, finding it now in the person of Jesus and in the community of believers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dwelling in the Household of God &lt;/i&gt;moves us from seeing God&#39;s dwelling place as the Temple to seeing God&#39;s dwelling place within the community of believers. The starting point now is an image in John 14:2: my Father&#39;s house, which is given its Old Testament meaning of my father&#39;s household. Our awareness thus moves, like that of the first Christians, from understanding My father&#39;s house as the Temple (John 2:16) to My Father&#39;s Household as a community of believers drawn into Jesus &#39; own divine filiation. Coloe invites us to re-read the gospel from the post-Easter perspective of those who have become brothers and sisters of Jesus and living Temples of God&#39;s presence. What emerges is nothing less than a profound mysticism of the mutual indwelling of God and believers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Mary Coloe, PBVM, DTh, holds a joint teaching position at the Australian Catholic University and St Paul&#39;s Seminary, Brisbane. Her publications include numerous articles and &lt;/i&gt;God Dwells With Us: Temple Symbolism in the Fourth Gospel&lt;i&gt; (Liturgical Press, 2001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
