  <title>Healing the Hurting Woman - Angela Hill-Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The relationship between a father and daughter is one of the most important in a womans life. But what happens when there is no father, or if the father is the perpetrator of evil against his own flesh? When this happens, many women are left wounded. Often turning to drugs, sex, and despair. They become angry at God or believe the lies of the enemy that theyve gone too far, and God wont forgive them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Angela Hill-Jones Healing the Hurting Woman speaks to that pain and sheds light on the lies of the enemy. Using Gods Word, she proves that no matter how far away from Him youve traveled, He waits for you to reach out and fall into His safe, loving arms of protection and restoration. Reflective questions and spaces to write your answers and thoughts will help you internalize what youve read and discover Him working in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hill-Jones writes from firsthand experience. She knows what its like when ones soul feels empty. The words of Healing the Hurting Woman are like open-heart surgery for the soul.&lt;/p&gt;" />
