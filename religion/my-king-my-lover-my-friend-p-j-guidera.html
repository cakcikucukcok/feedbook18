  <title>My King, My Lover, My Friend - P. J. Guidera</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The mysteries of the Lords ways are often higher than we could ever hope to go.  But He is not a God Who cannot be known, Who cannot be understood, or Who hides Himself from His beloved creations.  He is a God Who reveals Himself in both subtle and obvious ways and Who desires for His people to recognize the Voice and the Fingerprints of the One Whom they serve.  This short collection of poems, essays, commentaries, and prayers aims to help those seeking the Face of their Father to see Him just a bit more clearly and to know and understand their God in a manner that delights His Spirit.  Deeply personal and drawn from the authors own journals, life experiences, and meditations, this book hopes to further reveal a not-so-hidden God to a world and to a people in desperate need of the truth and love of their Savior.&lt;/p&gt;" />
