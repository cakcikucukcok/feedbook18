  <title>And Jacob Digged a Well - Theodore M. Snider</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The subject of Christology has been a struggle for the church from the very beginning. It has resulted in divisions, crusades, inquisitions, persecutions, and a wide range of creeds. Each group claims it possesses the trutha truth revealed to them, a particular turn on belief they alone rightly proclaim. In &lt;i&gt;And Jacob Digged a Well&lt;/i&gt;, author Pastor Theodore M. Snider provides a commentary on religionwhere its been, where its headed, and how it fits in the modern world. He seeks to answer this question: why do we believe what we believe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snider discusses how scientific and technological discoveries have changed not only our worldviews but also our Godviews and how consciousness and brain research are altering the way we understand each other and how beliefs are formed. He compiles a diverse amount of information on topics relevant to both secular and religious audiences, including creationism, evolution, intelligent design, and artificial intelligence through historical, scientific, cognitive, and psychological avenues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Jacob Digged a Well reminds us that natural may not be as clear as we once thought. Faith in the twenty-first century needs to look
quite different from the past century.&lt;/p&gt;" />
