  <title>And These Signs Will Follow - Rich Coyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The sheer number of miraculous interventions recounted in this book may tempt readers to assume that Mr. Rich Coyle made up these stories to bring glory to himself as a paragon of virtue and faith. Having known Mr. Coyle for more than twenty years, I can personally vouch for his honesty, integrity and genuine humility. I have no problem at all believing the miracles recounted in this volume for I know the faith of the man who experienced them and I know the power of Jesus Christ whom he serves. I do not believe it is possible to read this book without being inspired to grow in faith and believe God to manifest His supernatural power in our lives. Mr. Coyle has received from the mighty hand of God so many times because he simply believes Gods word is true. His faith is perhaps best summed up in this single verse of scripture: Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today and forever (Hebrews 13:8).
Dr. Thomas J. Kindell, ThD, PhD, founder and president of Reasons for Faith Ministries, Inc.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is put together so well, its like someone else did it!
