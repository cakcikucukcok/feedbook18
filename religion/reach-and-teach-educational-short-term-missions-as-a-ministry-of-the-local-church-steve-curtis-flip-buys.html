  <title>Reach and Teach: Educational Short-Term Missions as a Ministry of the Local Church - Steve Curtis, Flip Buys</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many churches are involved in short-term mission trips. Most of these trips, however, are focused on economic or social development projects, coupled with &quot;relational evangelism.&quot; Not many are focused on discipleship, or, more specifically, training indigenous pastors in the essential doctrines of the faith so that they can, in turn, disciple their church. In fact, reproducible models for in-depth theological education during short-term missions are rare. As a missionary presently ministering in a number of underdeveloped nations, Steve Curtis has witnessed the need for, and potential benefit of, such models. The reality is that there are countless pastors throughout the majority world who have had little to no formal training in Bible or doctrine. This book suggests a practical way that churches can use their short-term missions program--together with their adult discipleship program--to help meet this critical, global need." />
