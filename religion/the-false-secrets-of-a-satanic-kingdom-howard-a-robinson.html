  <title>The False Secrets of a Satanic Kingdom - Howard A. Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We live within a world where the masses of society have lost their understanding and perspective of spiritual realities. There are many who feel that the existence of demonic activity is only for the fantasy world of the silver screen. As such, we have ignored the truth of the world of Satan and his kingdom. In this read, you will find testimony from former third-world witch doctors who spent their lives practicing witchcraft and performing supernatural feats. You will find discussion of their ability to affect the lives of individuals and summon the activity of demons. They will tell of their ability and inability to affect Christians with their incantations and spells. Finally, you will read of how they came to give their lives to Christ and serve God&#39;s kingdom. The author shares the truth of the Word of God to counter the false realities of the demonic powers of darkness. In a time when movies and television share more and more the glorification of Satanism, we need this refreshing revelation of the power granted to the believer to be overcomers of the false secrets of the satanic kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 2:24-25&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24 Now I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, to you who do not hold to her teaching and have not learned Satan&#39;s so-called deep secrets, &quot;I will not impose any other burden on you, 25 Only hold on to what you have until I come.&quot; NIV&lt;/p&gt;" />
