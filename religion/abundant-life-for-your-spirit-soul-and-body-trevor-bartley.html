  <title>Abundant Life for Your Spirit, Soul and Body - Trevor Bartley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Our opening verse for this book is from John 10:10b, I came that they may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance (to the full, till it overflows). The Greek word used here for life is zo. So we can conclude that Jesus came to show us how to have and enjoy the god kind of life. As a born-again believer you have been recreated and given a new life code (or DNA) to live by, and Jesus came to show us how to live that new creation reality here on earth.
The Bible tells us in John 3:16, For God so greatly loved and dearly prized the world that He (even) gave up His only begotten (unique) Son, so that whoever believes in (trusts in, clings to, relies on) Him shall not perish (come to destruction, be lost) but have eternal (everlasting) life. Then in Romans 6:23 it tells us, For the wages which sin pays is death, but the bountiful free gift of God is eternal (the god kind of) life through and in union with Jesus Christ our Lord.
This eternal life he came to give us is the very nature of God. In John 1:4 we can get a better understanding of what this life will do for us: In Him was Life, and the Life was the Light of men. One of the meanings for light in the dictionary is a state of understanding or awareness. So we could read this verse like this: in him was the god kind of life, and the god kind of life was the state of understanding and awareness for men.
Let us live out of the zo kind of life and determine to be led by the spirit of God in all that we do so we can live in the actual abundance of God. Amen." />
