  <title>After the Cradle Falls - Melissa Jonson-Reid, Brett Drake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There may be no other social problem so common, yet so little understood by the general public, as child abuse and neglect. This book is intended to help remedy that situation.&lt;em&gt; After the Cradle Falls&lt;/em&gt; integrates examples from folklore, songs, and news articles with the latest summary of empirical research to create an accessible and engaging work intended to provoke the reader to think about how to address the issue of child abuse and neglect in America. Written in a conversational style, the book engages the reader in thinking through why maltreatment occurs, what it looks like, and what we do and do not know. Most importantly, it asks the reader to become involved in the solution based on their own conclusions and values.
The contingent in the US that believes that child maltreatment is not &quot;real&quot; but rather a socially constructed attempt to punish parents is categorically false and easily refuted by data. Given the prevailing state of widespread public misunderstanding about child abuse, its causes and effects, and the involved systems, &lt;em&gt;After the Cradle Falls&lt;/em&gt; is particularly current, relevant, and useful. It is a must-read for students, professionals in child advocacy or family services agencies, and policymakers." />
