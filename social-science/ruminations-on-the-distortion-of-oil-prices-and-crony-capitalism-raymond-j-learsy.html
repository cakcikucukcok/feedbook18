  <title>Ruminations on the Distortion of Oil Prices and Crony Capitalism - Raymond J. Learsy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At great cost and risk to the American and world economies, consumers are ripped off billions of dollars every day by oil interests and their malevolent influence on market pricing mechanisms.  Its essential Americans and oil consumers throughout the world understand where the money they pay for oils downstream products goesincluding the money paid at the pump, the money paid to heat their homes, and the money paid for the array of other petroleum-based products.  In Ruminations on the Distortion of Oil Prices and Crony Capitalism, author Raymond J. Learsy not only discusses the distortion of oil pricing, but also focuses on effects of the crony capitalism that has enriched a select few and left Main Street in the lurch as a result of government mismanagement, moneyed influence, and craven oversight. This collection of previously published writings shows how speculators ratchet up the prices of basic material goods essential to daily lives. Learsy describes how ceding the determination of those prices not to the laws of supply and demand but predominantly to gambling dens on the trading floors of commodity exchanges as well as the price fixing collusion of producer nations (OPEC) is crippling to the worlds economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing as well on Wall Streets corrupting influence on the price of oil, gasoline, and other commodities, Ruminations on the Distortion of Oil Prices and Crony Capitalism provides an overview of the basic and important theme: the United States enslavement to oil and the moneyed interests inextricably tied to it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
