  <title>Where We Want to Live - Ryan Gravel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;**Winner, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Phillip D. Reed Award for Outstanding Writing on the Southern Environment**&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;**A Planetizen Top&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; Planning Book for 2017**&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After decades of sprawl, many American city and suburban residents struggle with issues related to traffic (and its accompanying challenges for our health and productivity), divided neighborhoods, and a non-walkable life. Urban designer Ryan Gravel makes a case for how we can change this. Cities have the capacity to create a healthier, more satisfying way of life by remodeling and augmenting their infrastructure in ways that connect neighborhoods and communities. Gravel came up with a way to do just that in his hometown with the Atlanta Beltline project. It connects 40 diverse Atlanta neighborhoods to city schools, shopping districts, and public parks, and has already seen a huge payoff in real estate development and local business revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar projects are in the works around the country, from the Los Angeles River Revitalization and the Buffalo Bayou in Houston to the Midtown Greenway in Minneapolis and the Underline in Miami. In &lt;i&gt;Where We Want to Live&lt;/i&gt;, Gravel presents an exciting blueprint for revitalizing cities to make them places where we truly want to live.&lt;/p&gt;" />
