  <title>Porsche Boxster and Cayman - Johnny Tipler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Porsche Boxster and Cayman follows the design and development of this mid-engined sports car and coupe family, from their origins in the company&#39;s concerted racing activities in the 1950s and 1960s, to the drawing board, launch and systematic evolution through successive model ranges from 1996 to 2016.  There are detailed profiles and evaluation of all Boxster and Cayman derivatives, including 986, 987, 981 and 718. Specifications of the various models are given including entry-level, S, GTS and GT-4.  The special Limited Editions, such as the 550 Spyder 40th Anniversary models are also included. The book covers some of the author&#39;s international driving experiences at the wheel of Boxster and Cayman including the Bilster Berg race circuit and Tour Auto.  There is also an intriguing interview with successful racer Rebecca Jackson, who describes the techniques of Boxster racing and demonstrates the versatility of this best-handling of all Porsche sports cars and an iInterview with Porsche design chief Harm Lagaaij. The book will be of great interest to all motoring enthusiasts and historians and is illustrated with 400 colour photographs, many specially commissioned." />
