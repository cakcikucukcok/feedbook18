  <title>Darkness Falls - Jamie Lynn Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Matthew Tucker is a successful actor on a hit television show, his career on the rise. Life is good. What more could he want? Daniel Westman, that&#39;s what - his co-star and close friend.  Matthew&#39;s attraction to Daniel grows day by day, feeling there&#39;s something between them, just under the surface. But months go by, with Matthew afraid to tell Daniel he was falling in love with him. Because if he was wrong and Matthew was looking too deeply into it...he&#39;d lose his best friend. So instead Matthew longs for Daniel in silence, until an accident on set may leave Daniel permanently blind. With his friend hurt, scared and confused, his life possibly forever altered, Matthew never wavers from Daniel&#39;s side, no matter how difficult it gets.  His dedication brings them closer than ever before, but is it possible to find happiness, and love, in the wake of a tragedy? Or has Matthew&#39;s hesitation cost him that chance and he&#39;ll lose Daniel to the darkness instead?" />
