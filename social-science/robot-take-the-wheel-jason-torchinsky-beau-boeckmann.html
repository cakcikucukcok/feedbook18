  <title>Robot, Take the Wheel - Jason Torchinsky, Beau Boeckmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the witty senior editor of Jalopnik, Gizmodo Media&amp;rsquo;s acclaimed website devoted to cars, technology, and more, comes a revealing, savvy, and humorous look at self-driving cars.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Self-driving cars sound fantastical and futuristic and yet they&amp;rsquo;ll soon be on every street in America. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s Tesla&amp;rsquo;s Autopilot, Google&amp;rsquo;s Waymo, Mercedes&amp;rsquo;s Distronic, or Uber&amp;rsquo;s 24,000 modified Volvos, companies across industries and throughout the world are developing autonomous cars. Even Apple, not to be outdone, is rumored to be creating its own technology too.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Robot, Take the Wheel&lt;/i&gt;, Jason Torchinsky explores the state of the automotive industry. Through wit and wisdom, he explains why autonomous cars are being made and what the future of automated cars is. Torchinsky encourages us to consider autonomous cars as an entirely new machine, something beyond cars as we understand them today. He considers how we&amp;rsquo;ll get along with these robots that will take over our cars&#39; jobs, what they will look like, what sorts of jobs they may do, what we can expect of them, how they should act, ethically, how we can have fun with them, and how we can make sure there&amp;rsquo;s still a place for those of us who love to drive with manual or automatic transmission.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This unique and highly readable volume is brimming with industry insider information and destined to be a conversation starter. It&amp;rsquo;s a must-have for car lovers, technology geeks, and everyone who wants to know what&amp;rsquo;s on the road ahead.&lt;/p&gt;" />
