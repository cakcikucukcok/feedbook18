  <title>Righting Feminism: Conservative Women and American Politics - Ronnee Schreiber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When we think of women&#39;s activism in America, figures such as Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan invariably come to mind--those liberal doyennes who have fought for years to chip away at patriarchy and achieve gender equality. But women&#39;s interests are not synonymous with organizations like NOW anymore. As Ronnee Schreiber shows, the conservative ascendancy that began in the Reagan era has been accompanied by the emergence of a broad-based conservative women&#39;s movement. And while firebrands like Ann Coulter and Phyllis Schlafly may be the public face of rightwing women&#39;s activism, a handful of large and established women&#39;s organizations have proven to be the most effective promoters of the conservative agenda.
  Righting Feminism shows that one of the key--albeit overlooked--developments in political activism since the 1980s has been the emergence of conservative women&#39;s organizations. It focuses on the most prominent of these groups, Concerned Women for America and the Independent Women&#39;s Forum, to reveal how they are using feminist rhetoric for conservative ends: outlawing abortion, restricting pornography, and bolstering the traditional family. But ironically, these organizations face a paradox: to combat the legacy of feminism--particularly its appeal to the majority of American women--they must use the rhetoric of women&#39;s empowerment. Indeed, Schreiber amply illustrates how conservative activists are often the beneficiaries of the very feminist politics they oppose. Yet just as importantly, she demolishes two widely believed truisms: that conservatism holds no appeal to women and that modern conservatism is hostile to the very notion of women&#39;s activism. 
  Based on numerous interviews with colorful conservative activists and extensive analyses of organizational documents, Righting Feminism offers a new way of understanding the unlikely intersection of women&#39;s activism and conservative politics in America today." />
