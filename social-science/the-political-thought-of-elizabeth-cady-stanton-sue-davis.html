  <title>The Political Thought of Elizabeth Cady Stanton - Sue Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2009 &lt;i&gt;Choice&lt;/i&gt; Outstanding Academic Title&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815-1902) was not only one of the most important leaders of the nineteenth century women&amp;#8217;s rights movement but was also the movement&amp;#8217;s principal philosopher. Her ideas both drew from and challenged the conventions that so severely constrained women&amp;#8217;s choices and excluded them from public life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;b&gt;The Political Thought of Elizabeth Cady Stanton&lt;/b&gt;, Sue Davis argues that Cady Stanton&amp;#8217;s work reflects the rich tapestry of American political culture in the second half of the nineteenth century and that she deserves recognition as a major figure in the history of political ideas. Davis reveals the way that Cady Stanton&amp;#8217;s work drew from different political traditions ranging from liberalism, republicanism, inegalitarian ascriptivism, and radicalism. Cady Stanton&amp;#8217;s arguments for women&amp;#8217;s rights combined approaches that in contemporary feminist theory are perceived to involve conflicting strategies and visions. Nevertheless, her ideas had a major impact on the development of the varieties of feminism in the twentieth century. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thoroughly researched and engagingly written, &lt;b&gt;The Political Thought of Elizabeth Cady Stanton&lt;/b&gt; draws on a wide variety of primary and secondary sources and promises to fill a gap in the literature on the history of political ideas in the United States as well as women&amp;#8217;s history and feminist theory.&lt;/p&gt;" />
