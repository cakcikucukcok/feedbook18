  <title>My Week* - Hugo Rifkind</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 2006, as the gossip columnist for The Times, Hugo Rifkind realised it would be much easier to do his job if he could make all the stories up. So he did. For years now, Rifkind&#39;s hilarious &#39;My Week&#39; column has satirised anyone foolish or unfortunate enough to make headlines that week, entertaining politicos and casual readers alike. Each column acts as a fictional diary, parodying the musings of its target (and friends) for five days&#39; worth of comic value. Oprah, Bieber, Berlusconi (the gift who keeps on giving), Cameron, Clarkson, Obama, Mother Miliband and a Pic&#39;n&#39;mix shovel are just a few of those on his eclectic list of ill-fated victims. After much badgering from loyal fans, Rifkind has finally hand-selected his best, funniest and most poignant, here presented with new introductions. None are spared in this comical compilation, and readers old and new will delight in the satirical skewering of some of our most famous (and infamous) figures." />
