      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;
1996 was the worst year in avaiation history
I redesigned all aircraft in 1996
1997-today are the safest years in aviation history
My aircraft innovation that caused this crash reduction was submitted through the US Congress in early 1996.
14,000 people are alive today because of my invention that has only been in use for seven years
For all the crashes it&#39;s obviously prevented it&#39;s not installed in all of our aircraft today...
