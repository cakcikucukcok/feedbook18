  <title>The Shadow War - Jim Sciutto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are we losing a war few of us realize we&amp;#8217;re fighting? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Sciutto, CNN&amp;#8217;s Chief National Security Correspondent, reveals the invisible fronts that make up 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century warfare,&amp;#160;from disinformation campaigns to advanced satellite weapons.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poisoned dissidents. Election interference. Armed invasions. International treaties thrown into chaos. Secret military buildups. Hackers and viruses. Weapons deployed in space. China and Russia (and Iran and North Korea) spark news stories here by carrying out bold acts of aggression and violating international laws and norms. Isn&amp;#8217;t this just bad actors acting badly? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of thinking is outdated and dangerous. Emboldened by their successes, these countries are, in fact, waging a brazen, global war on the US and the West. This is a new Cold War, which will not be won by those who fail to realize they are fighting it. The enemies of the West understand that while they are unlikely to win a shooting war, they have another path to victory. And what we see as our greatest strengths&amp;#8212;open societies, military innovation, dominance of technology on Earth and in space, longstanding leadership in global institutions&amp;#8212;these countries are undermining or turning into weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Shadow War&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;CNN anchor and chief national security correspondent Jim Sciutto provides us with a revealing and at times disturbing guide to this new international conflict. This Shadow War is already the greatest threat to America&amp;#8217;s national security, even though most Americans know little or nothing about it. With on-the-ground reporting from Ukraine to the South China Sea, from a sub under the Arctic to unprecedented access to America&amp;#8217;s Space Command, Sciutto draws on his deep knowledge, high-level contacts, and personal experience as a journalist and diplomat to paint the most comprehensive and vivid picture of a nation targeted by a new and disturbing brand of warfare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, America is adapting and fighting back. In &lt;em&gt;The Shadow War&lt;/em&gt;, Sciutto introduces readers to the dizzying array of soldiers, sailors, submariners and their commanders, space engineers, computer scientists, civilians, and senior intelligence officials who are on the front lines of this new kind of forever war. Intensive and disturbing, this invaluable and important work opens our eyes and makes clear that the war of the future is already here.&lt;/p&gt;" />
