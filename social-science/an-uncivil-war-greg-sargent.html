  <title>An Uncivil War - Greg Sargent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;An Uncivil War&lt;/em&gt;, the&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8217;s&amp;#160;Greg Sargent sounds an urgent alarm about the deeper roots of our democratic backsliding&amp;#8212;and how we can begin to turn things around between now and 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American democracy is facing a crisis as fraught as we&amp;#8217;ve seen in decades. Donald Trump&amp;#8217;s presidency has raised the specter of authoritarian rule. Extreme polarization and the scorched-earth war between the parties drags on with no end in sight. The recent Kavanaugh confirmation hearings are only the latest example of this, and of the GOP&amp;#8217;s continued ability to steamroll the Democrats and their supporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of this dangerous moment is a paradox: It took a figure as uniquely menacing as Trump to rivet the nation&amp;#8217;s attention on the fragility of our democracy. Yet the causes of our dysfunction are long-running&amp;#8212;they predate Trump, helped facilitate his rise, and, distressingly, will outlast his presidency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;An Uncivil War,&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;Sargent reveals why we&amp;#8217;ve fallen into the ditch&amp;#8212;and how to get out of it. Drawing upon years of research and reporting, he exposes the unparalleled sophistication and ambition of GOP tactics, including computer-generated gerrymandering, underhanded voter suppression, and ever-escalating legislative hardball. We are also plagued by other brutal, seemingly intractable problems such as dismal turnout and powerful, built-in temptations to tilt the political playing field with unscrupulous partisan trickery. All of this has been accompanied by foreign-government intervention and an unprecedented level of political disinformation that threatens to undermine the very possibility of shared agreement on facts and poses profound new challenges to the media&amp;#8217;s ability to inform the citizenry. Yet the Republican Party is only part of the problem. As Sargent provocatively reveals, Democrats share culpability for helping to accelerate this slide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But our plight is far from hopeless, and Sargent offers a series of doable&amp;#160;prescriptions for saving our democracy, including a shift of focus toward state legislatures, creative voter registration policies, innovative approaches to fairer districting, and a new sense of purpose. The result is a book that could not be more essential as we head toward the elections that most matter.&lt;/p&gt;" />
