  <title>Aerotropolis - John D. Kasarda, Greg Lindsay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This brilliant and eye-opening look at the new phenomenon called the aerotropolis gives us a glimpse of the way we will live in the near future--and the way we will do business too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not so long ago, airports were built near cities, and roads connected the one to the other. This pattern--the city in the center, the airport on the periphery-- shaped life in the twentieth century, from the central city to exurban sprawl. Today, the ubiquity of jet travel, round-the-clock workdays, overnight shipping, and global business networks has turned the pattern inside out. Soon the airport will be at the center and the city will be built around it, the better to keep workers, suppliers, executives, and goods in touch with the global market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the aerotropolis: a combination of giant airport, planned city, shipping facility, and business hub. The aerotropolis approach to urban living is now reshaping life in Seoul and Amsterdam, in China and India, in Dallas and Washington, D.C. The aerotropolis is the frontier of the next phase of globalization, whether we like it or not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John D. Kasarda defined the term &quot;aerotropolis,&quot; and he is now sought after worldwide as an adviser. Working with Kasarda&#39;s ideas and research, the gifted journalist Greg Lindsay gives us a vivid, at times disquieting look at these instant cities in the making, the challenges they present to our environment and our usual ways of life, and the opportunities they offer to those who can exploit them creatively. &lt;i&gt;Aerotropolis &lt;/i&gt;is news from the near future--news we urgently need if we are to understand the changing world and our place in it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
