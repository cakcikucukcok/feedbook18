  <title>One of Us - Asne Seierstad, Sarah Death</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A harrowing and thorough account of the massacre that upended Norway, and the trial that helped put the country back together&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;On July 22, 2011, Anders Behring Breivik detonated a bomb outside government buildings in central Oslo, killing eight people. He then proceeded to a youth camp on the island of Utøya, where he killed sixty-nine more, most of them teenage members of Norway&#39;s governing Labour Party. In &lt;i&gt;One of Us&lt;/i&gt;, the journalist Åsne Seierstad tells the story of this terrible day and what led up to it. What made Breivik, a gifted child from an affluent neighborhood in Oslo, become a terrorist?&lt;br&gt;     As in her bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Bookseller of Kabul&lt;/i&gt;, Seierstad excels at the vivid portraiture of lives under stress. She delves deep into Breivik&#39;s troubled childhood, showing how a hip-hop and graffiti aficionado became a right-wing activist and Internet game addict, and then an entrepreneur, Freemason, and self-styled master warrior who sought to &quot;save Norway&quot; from the threat of Islam and multiculturalism. She writes with equal intimacy about Breivik&#39;s victims, tracing their political awakenings, aspirations to improve their country, and ill-fated journeys to the island. By the time Seierstad reaches Utøya, we know both the killer and those he will kill. We have also gotten to know an entire country--famously peaceful and prosperous, and utterly incapable of protecting its youth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
