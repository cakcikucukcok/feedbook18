  <title>Our 2Nd American Revolution - William E. Shuttleworth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the past year the elected leaders of the government of the United States have taken that nation down a road that can only lead to disaster. The federal government of the United States has borrowed more money in the past year alone than all of the debt accumulated since the nation&#39;s found more than 200 years ago. In the process of bankrupting America, the nationally elected leaders have on many occasions literally ignored the Constitution of the United States. The American people are patient; however, their patience has reached the breaking point, and, as a result, BIG changes are just around the corner for America. The book titled &quot;Our 2nd American Revolution: Honoring the Sacrifice of our Founders&quot; spells out how the American people will &quot;take back&quot; their nation beginning on November 2nd, 2010. This book includes a &quot;Nine Point Plan to Save America from an otherwise certain demise&quot; and breaks down step by step what must be done if America is to survive in the future. Our 2nd American Revolution is a book about saving America. America has drifted very far away from the fundamental principles that allowed her to become the richest and fastest growing nation ever to have existed. As a result, America is on a collision course with certain disaster. The goal of the &quot;Our 2nd American Revolution&quot; is to sound a loud wake up call to all Americans who love thier country and cannot bear to see the great American experiment fail. America can be saved if dramatic and bold action is taken soon. However, time is of the essence and the citizens of American must act, and act very soon.&lt;/p&gt;" />
