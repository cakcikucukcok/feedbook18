  <title>Dramatic Sketches of Constitutional Conservatism and What Is Xenophobia? - Loren Berengere</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The constitutional conservatives in this modern Socratic dialogue are two celebrity radio broadcast specialists, rhetoricians of simpleminded and well-meaning zeal, who have made a profitable profession of showing others how to make the best of themselves by practicing conservative principles.
Their strange interlocutor, exploiting the simplicity of his opponents in his effort to contrast rhetoric with dialectic and whose novel ideas would radicalize conservatism as an ideology, will convince them of their ignorance by clearing their minds of misconceptions and so helping them on their way to knowledge. What is Xenophobia? is an investigation into the fashionable abuse of derogatory words to promote a social goal." />
