  <title>Get Up, Stand Up: Uniting Populists, Energizing the Defeated, and Battling the Corporate Elite - Bruce E. Levine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Polls show that the majority of Americans oppose recent US wars and Wall Street bailouts, yet most remain passive and appear resigned to powerlessness. In &lt;em&gt;Get Up, Stand Up&lt;/em&gt;, Bruce Levine offers an original and convincing explanation for this passivity. Many Americans are deeply demoralized by decades of oppressive elitism, and they have lost confidence that genuine democracy is possible. Drawing on phenomena such as learned helplessness, the abuse syndrome, and other psychological principles and techniques for pacifying a population, Levine explains how major US institutions have created fatalism. When such fatalism and defeatism set in, truths about social and economic injustices are not enough to set people free.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, the situation is not truly hopeless. History tells us that for democratic movements to get off the ground, individuals must recover self-respect, and a people must regain collective confidence that they can succeed at eliminating top-down controls. &lt;em&gt;Get Up, Stand Up&lt;/em&gt; describes how we can recover dignity, confidence, and the energy to do battle. That achievement fills in the missing piece that, until now, has undermined so many efforts to energize genuine democracy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get Up, Stand Up&lt;/em&gt; details those strategies and tactics that oppressed peoples have successfully employed to gain power. We the People can unite, gain strength, wisely do battle, and wrest power away from the ruling corporate-government partnership (the &quot;corporatocracy&quot;). &lt;em&gt;Get Up, Stand Up&lt;/em&gt; explains how.&lt;/p&gt;" />
