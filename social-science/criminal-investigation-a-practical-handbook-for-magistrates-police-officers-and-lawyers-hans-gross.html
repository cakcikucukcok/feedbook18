  <title>Criminal Investigation - A Practical Handbook for Magistrates, Police Officers, and Lawyers - Hans Gross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The aim of this book is to be as practical as possible. It is not a law book, though we confidently hope that it will be of the greatest interest to lawyers. It is not a work on medical jurisprudence, though we trust that medical men will find it useful and suggestive. It is a Manual of Instruction for all engaged in investigating crime.&lt;br /&gt;
The book, following the author&amp;rsquo;s arrangement, has been divided into four parts. Part I. is designed, in the first place, to enunciate those general principles and qualities, the lack or neglect of which proclaim an investigator unfitted for the sphere in life in which it is his misfortune to be placed ; and, in the second place, to inform him in a general way what assistance science can afford in the investigation of crime, and in a more detailed manner to show in just what cases expert knowledge may be effectively brought to bear. Advice is also given regarding the examination of witnesses and accused and the inspection of localities. Parts II. and III. deal respectively with various heads of knowledge and certain handicrafts with which every Investigating Officer should be thoroughly well acquainted ; while Part IV. gives information upon the methods of criminals in committing particular offences, much of which may be new even to experienced detectives. (1906 &amp;ndash; The Authors)" />
