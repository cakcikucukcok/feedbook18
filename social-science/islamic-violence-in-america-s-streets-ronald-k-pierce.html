  <title>Islamic Violence in America’S Streets - Ronald K. Pierce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The growth of Islam in the United States looks much like an invasion with the Muslim population numbering more than three million. Mosques in the United States number more than two thousand and growing rapidly. 
In Islamic Violence in Americas Streets, author Ronald K. Pierce offers a clear and balanced discussion that explores the many aspects of Islam as it has and will affect the American experience.
Islamic Violence in Americas Streets describes the significant dangers America faces from this ideology/religion that seeks to dominate America. It:
Reviews what Islam is, how it operates, and why it has been
	successful in attracting followers
Looks at the impact the movement has had and is having on the Middle East, South Asia, and Europe
Discusses Sharia law, which is a vital underpinning to Islamic success, and why it is so critical it not be introduced into the United States
Shares stories of those who have left the religion (in many cases in the face of great danger) and why
Examines the threat to America and what actions can be taken to reduce or eliminate that threat
Pierce shows why the threat to the United States is urgent. He calls on citizens and Congress to understand it and take action to defuse it." />
