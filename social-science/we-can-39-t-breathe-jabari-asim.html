  <title>We Can&#39;t Breathe - Jabari Asim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Finalist for the PEN/Diamonstein-Spielvogel Award for the Art of the Essay &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Insightful and searing essays that celebrate the vibrancy and strength of black history and culture in America by critically acclaimed writer Jabari Asim&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;i&gt;We Can&#39;t Breathe&lt;/i&gt;, Jabari Asim disrupts what Toni Morrison has exposed as the &quot;Master Narrative&quot; and replaces it with a story of black survival and persistence through art and community in the face of centuries of racism. In eight wide-ranging and penetrating essays, he explores such topics as the twisted legacy of jokes and falsehoods in black life; the importance of black fathers and community; the significance of black writers and stories; and the beauty and pain of the black body. What emerges is a rich portrait of a community and culture that has resisted, survived, and flourished despite centuries of racism, violence, and trauma. These thought-provoking essays present a different side of American history, one that doesn&#39;t depend on a narrative steeped in oppression but rather reveals black voices telling their own stories.&lt;/p&gt;" />
