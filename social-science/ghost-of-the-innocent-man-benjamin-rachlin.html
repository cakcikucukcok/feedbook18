  <title>Ghost of the Innocent Man - Benjamin Rachlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A gripping account of one man&#39;s long road to freedom that will forever change how we understand our criminal justice system.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; During the last three decades, more than two thousand American citizens have been wrongfully convicted. &lt;i&gt;Ghost of the Innocent Man&lt;/i&gt; brings us one of the most dramatic of those cases and provides the clearest picture yet of the national scourge of wrongful conviction and of the opportunity for meaningful reform. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When the final gavel clapped in a rural southern courtroom in the summer of 1988, Willie J. Grimes, a gentle spirit with no record of violence, was shocked and devastated to be convicted of first-degree rape and sentenced to life imprisonment. Here is the story of this everyman and his extraordinary quarter-century-long journey to freedom, told in breathtaking and sympathetic detail, from the botched evidence and suspect testimony that led to his incarceration to the tireless efforts to prove his innocence and the identity of the true perpetrator. These were spearheaded by his relentless champion, Christine Mumma, a cofounder of North Carolina&#39;s Innocence Inquiry Commission. That commission -- unprecedented at its inception in 2006 -- remains a model organization unlike any other in the country, and one now responsible for a growing number of exonerations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; With meticulous, prismatic research and pulse-quickening prose, Benjamin Rachlin presents one man&#39;s tragedy and triumph. The jarring and unsettling truth is that the story of Willie J. Grimes, for all its outrage, dignity, and grace, is not a unique travesty. But through the harrowing and suspenseful account of one life, told from the inside, we experience the full horror of wrongful conviction on a national scale. &lt;i&gt;Ghost of the Innocent Man&lt;/i&gt; is both rare and essential, a masterwork of empathy. The book offers a profound reckoning not only with the shortcomings of our criminal justice system but also with its possibilities for redemption. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;Remarkable . . . Captivating . . . Rachlin is a skilled storyteller.&quot;-&lt;i&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;A gripping legal-thriller mystery . . . Profoundly elevates good-cause advocacy to greater heights -- to where innocent lives are saved.&quot;-&lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;A crisply written page turner.&quot;-NPR" />
