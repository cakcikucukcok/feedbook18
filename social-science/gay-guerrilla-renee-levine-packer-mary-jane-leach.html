  <title>Gay Guerrilla - Renee Levine Packer, Mary Jane Leach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Composer-performer Julius Eastman (1940-90) was an enigma, both comfortable and uncomfortable in the many worlds he inhabited: black, white, gay, straight, classical music, disco, academia, and downtown New York. His music, insistent and straightforward, resists labels and seethes with a tension that resonates with musicians, scholars, and audiences today. Eastman&#39;s provocative titles, including &lt;I&gt;Gay Guerrilla&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;Evil Nigger&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;Crazy Nigger&lt;/I&gt;, and others, assault us with his obsessions.&lt;BR&gt; Eastman tested limits with his political aggressiveness, as reflected in legendary scandals like his June 1975 performance of John Cage&#39;s Song Books, which featured homoerotic interjections, and the uproar over his titles at Northwestern University. These episodes are examples of Eastman&#39;s persistence in pushing the limits of the acceptable in the highly charged arenas of sexual and civil rights.&lt;BR&gt; In addition to analyses of Eastman&#39;s music, the essays in &lt;I&gt;Gay Guerrilla&lt;/I&gt; provide background on his remarkable life history and the era&#39;s social landscape. The book presents an authentic portrait of a notable American artist that is compelling reading for the general reader as well as scholars interested in twentieth-century American music, American studies, gay rights, and civil rights.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&lt;   Contributors: David Borden, Luciano Chessa, Ryan Dohoney, Kyle Gann, AndrewHanson-Dvoracek, R.
