There is a substantial class of voters who would like to do good but ignore important consequences of their attempts to do sonave altruists. The book both shows why such a class exists and tests the implications of that groups behavior in a setting where other voters are self-interested, others are traditionalists, and imitation plays a big role in voter choice. The book also looks at the policy implications of such behavior accepting as desirable, but not fully achievable, the democratic ideal in which sufficiently informed citizens are given equal weight in political choices.

That ignorance produces too much of that redistribution in terms of the democratic ideal." />
