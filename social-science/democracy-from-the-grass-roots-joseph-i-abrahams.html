  <title>Democracy from the Grass Roots - Joseph I. Abrahams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In an historic turn, grassroots America has overcome its apathy and cyclic reversion
to the ways of the past, last induced by Islamic fundamentalism. Newly cognizant of
its inherent interests, grassroots America has responded to the vision of Barak Obama
and Hillary Clinton, and fl ocked to the polls. The emotions of politics take front
and center. In Democracy From The Grassroots: A Guide to Creative Politics, we
examine in depth the political passion of the grassroots and these emergent leaders.
Beginning with an inspiring historical overview of grassroots politics in America,
the author then guides us through its organizational structuresthe political
clubs, committees, councils, caucuses, and workshops wherein real people work to
create real change. A chapter devoted to the analysis of issues, the systems which
determine their resolution, and their role in the political campaign, serves to
enlighten and motivatethe ideal lead-in to an exhaustive section on training.
A concise summary integrates the hypotheses set forth about the role of grassroots
politics in American social development. And in a unique and compelling twist,
that model is then compared to the individuals development as a person.
Written by psychoanalyst, political activist and scholar Dr. Joseph Abrahams,
Democracy From the Grassroots, A Guide to Creative Political Action presents the
pioneering work of three decades in the grassroots trenches. At once a vibrant
history lesson and a call to action, this slender volume is as lush in practical howto
as it is in thoughtful refl ection and insight. The appendix is remarkable for
its richly annotated bibliography and a revealing chronicle of the events and
issues of American grassroots movements." />
