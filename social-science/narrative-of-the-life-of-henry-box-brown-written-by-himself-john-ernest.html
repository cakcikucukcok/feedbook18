  <title>Narrative of the Life of Henry Box Brown, Written by Himself - John Ernest</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is the most celebrated escape in the history of American slavery. Henry Brown had himself sealed in a three-foot-by-two-foot box and shipped from Richmond, Virginia, to Philadelphia, a twenty-seven-hour journey to freedom. In &lt;i&gt;Narrative of the Life of Henry Box Brown, Written by Himself&lt;/i&gt;, Brown not only tells the story of his famed escape, but also recounts his later life as a black man making his way through white American and British culture. Most important, he paints a revealing portrait of the reality of slavery, of the wife and children sold away from him, the home to which he could not return, and his rejection of the slaveholders&#39; religion--painful episodes that fueled his desire for freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This edition comprises the most complete and faithful representation of Brown&#39;s life, fully annotated for the first time. John Ernest also provides an insightful introduction that places Brown&#39;s life in its historical setting and illuminates the challenges Brown faced in an often threatening world, both before and after his legendary escape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
