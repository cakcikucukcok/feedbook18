  <title>Skullduggery! - Ted Krager</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Today, in 2012, the country is again just as torn as it has was in the 1970s due once again to Middle East wars, the Great Recession of 2007 - 2012, President Obama&#39;s constant and incendiary rhetoric, incessant politicking over race, ObamaCare, divisive dialogue of the haves and have-nots, his infamous campaign gaffe to Joe the Plumber, &quot;spread the wealth around&quot;, the &quot;99% vs the Top 1%&quot; (class warfare), &quot;millionaires and billionaires&quot; and his war with big business. So much for &quot;Hope and Change&quot;, &quot;Change We Can Believe In&quot; and my favorite &quot;the first post-racial president.&quot; To the contrary, the United States of America is as unsettled, divided and angry as I have seen it since the 1960&#39;s and the early 1970&#39;s. The big questions are easy ones: &quot;Why?&quot; and &quot;What caused this return to the anger and the hostilities of the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s?&quot; Since I am part of the baby boom generation and was very much a participant in both the professions of Wall Street and mortgage banking, I am in a unique position to tell you about what I saw and heard up close and personal in the 1960&#39;s - 1970&#39;s AND about the decade that led up to what culminated in the Great Recession of 2007-2012 that we are still clawing our way out of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few things that might surprise you, further discussed in this book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The overwhelming majority of &quot;Greedy Wall Streeters&quot; and &quot;Fat Cat Bankers&quot; are massive and consistent donors to liberal Democrats, even in 2012 in the face of Obama&#39;s persistent (and false) accusations of casting them as the &quot;fat cat bankers&quot; and &quot;greedy Wall Streeters&quot; as causing the recession!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The senior most executives in these companies pilloried by President Obama, gave upwards of 60% of total donations, over $20M, to Obama&#39;s 2008 presidential campaign and his Political Action Committees into 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. The earliest beginnings of the current Financial Crisis started back in the late 1970&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Some of the names that were catalysts of the Financial Crisis are very well known activists, anarchists, life-long socialists, present and former D.C. politicians and three very well known U.S. presidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. And, just in case you have not done your research or taken the time to trace the trail of bread crumbs back to the source... you need to know the irrefutable reality that: The Subprime Mortgage Crisis = The Financial Crisis of 2007 - 2012&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. From the very beginnings of The Financial Crisis in the fall of 2007, the media referred to this as The Subprime Mortgage Crisis, until they didn&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;" />
