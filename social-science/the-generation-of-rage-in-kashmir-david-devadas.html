  <title>The Generation of Rage in Kashmir - David Devadas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="2008, 2010, and 2016—three important points in recent history when mass rage emerged in Kashmir. But the reasons that pushed Kashmir to the brink on these three occasions were different from each other—from a perceived threat to identity, to rage over the killing of innocents, to support for militancy. If one looks closely, one could spot another important change: by 2016, a new generation of millennials had replaced those who had pelted stones in 2008. And, in a matter of a mere decade, the hope that was slowly permeating Kashmir suddenly collapsed and gave way to a new round of militancy. In this book David Devadas, a respected authority on Kashmir, delves into his deep understanding of the region and its youth to offer a unique understanding of the Kashmir issue. He relates the increase in the generation of rage in Kashmir to the inability of those in power to declare the end of militancy at the right time. Exploring vital aspects of the conflict economy, murders for rewards, and terror acts by state-backed mercenaries, Devadas shows how simplistic black-and-white narratives suit both pro- and anti-state actors equally and lead the poor and marginal to their deaths." />
