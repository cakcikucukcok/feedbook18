  <title>Unshackle the Dark Continent - Eric Ikenna Nwokedi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The need to dominate the planet and keep the western empire immortal has remained the driving force behind Americas policies towards some defenseless countries around the world. Notable among them are African countries whose material and human resources has for hundred of years remained their target and primary source of raw material and energy that fuel their economic engine. &lt;br&gt;
To dominate the planet, war was waged both on the political,
economic as well as on the military front. On the military front, seven unified military commands are strategically created and located to oversee all the battle that will rage within each individual geographic regions. Among the Unified Military Command is the newly created AFRICOM whose overall mission should be of concern to Africans mainly because it will not only oversee all the battle that will rage in
the dark continent but will also be a source of intimidation to any potential rival to the installed puppet governments and the resources in the region. On the financial front, the World Bank, IMF, WTO and others have been in the fore front of the economic decay that bedeviled Nigeria in particular and Africa in general. On the political front, however, the UN and their affi liated agencies are all agent of control and have all served specific purposes in dominating and controlling the world and have charted the course that favors only
the chosen countries." />
