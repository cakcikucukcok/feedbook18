  <title>People In Trouble - Wilhelm Reich, Philip Schmitz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;First published by Reich in 1953, &lt;i&gt;People in Trouble&lt;/i&gt; is an autobiographical work in which Reich describes the development of his sociological thinking from 1927 to 1937. In simple narrative form he recounts his personal experiences with major social and political events and ideas, and reveals how these experiences gradually led him to an awareness of the deep significance of the human character structure in shaping and responding to the social process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The importance of Karl Marx&#39;s work and its distortion by communist politicians plays an important role in Reich&#39;s account, as does the political activity in the International Psychoanalytic Association which led to his expulsion from that organization in 1934. The Norwegian press campaign against his biological experiments is also discussed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;People in Trouble&lt;/i&gt; is the story of one man&#39;s courageous struggle to understand the political activity of his fellow men.&lt;/p&gt;" />
