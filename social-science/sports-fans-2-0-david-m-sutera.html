  <title>Sports Fans 2.0 - David M. Sutera</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;As of 2012, Twitter has over 100 million active users worldwide, generating close to 230 million Tweets per day. Encouraged by sports shows that incorporate social media as a major component of their programming strategies, sports fans and athletes have proven to be some of the most prolific and adept users of Twitter and other social media platforms. Social media has made it possible for fans to cross the virtual barrier that separates them from the teams they love and the athletes they follow, changing the way fans and athletes interact in the world of sports.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Sports Fans 2.0: How Fans Are Using Social Media to Get Closer to the Game&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, David M. Sutera explores the increasingly participatory nature of contemporary sports fandom and spectatorship. He examines the ways in which digital media has created and facilitated new channels for sports fan engagement, and how technology has enhanced the fan&amp;rsquo;s perception of participating in America&amp;rsquo;s sports culture. In addition, Sutera shows how high-profile athletes are using social media to increase their fan base and promote their own celebrity status, creating the sense that they are more accessible to their fans. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Social media has forever altered the way sports fans and athletes engage with each other. Covering a wide range of sports and social media outlets, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Sports Fans 2.0 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;is an accessible examination of how technology has changed&amp;mdash;and will continue to change&amp;mdash;the world of sports. Written for general readers and scholars alike, this book will appeal to anyone interested in the effects of social media on popular culture. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
