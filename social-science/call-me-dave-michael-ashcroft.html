  <title>Call Me Dave - Michael Ashcroft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="He has led the Conservative Party for a decade and entered his second term as Prime Minister, but he remains an enigma to those outside his exclusive inner circle. Finally, this unauthorised biography reveals the real David Cameron. Packed with revelations, from his illegal drug taking before he entered Parliament to his panic at the prospect of losing Scotland and his tears of joy and disbelief when he won the 2015 election, it examines the man behind the mask, and the highs and lows of his administration. Based on hundreds of interviews with friends and foes, including Downing Street insiders, it charts his life from his blissful childhood in rural Berkshire, through to Eton and Oxford, his early years as a Tory Party apparatchik, his stint as a PR man and his rise to political power. With fly-on-the-wall accounts of his life behind closed doors, this authoritative biography offers a fascinating insight into his most intriguing relationships, including with his wife Samantha, the Chancellor George Osborne and his old rival Boris Johnson. From madcap schemes for Syria to the day his trousers split from top to bottom during an official engagement, it never spares his blushes - but also highlights the extraordinary achievements of Britain&amp;rsquo;s youngest Prime Minister for 200 years." />
