  <title>A Durkheimian Quest: Solidarity and the Sacred - William Watts Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; 	Durkheim, in his very role as a &#39;founding father&#39; of a new social science, sociology, has become like a &amp;#64257;gure in an old religious painting, enshrouded in myth and encrusted in layers of thick, impenetrable varnish. This book undertakes detailed, up-to-date investigations of Durkheim&#39;s work in an effort to restore its freshness and reveal it as originally created. These investigations explore his particular ideas, within an overall narrative of his initial problematic search for solidarity, how it became a quest for the sacred and how, at the end of his life, he embarked on a project for a new great work on ethics. A theme running through this is his concern with a modern world in crisis and his hope in social and moral reform. Accordingly, the book concludes with a set of essays on modern times and on a crisis that Durkheim thought would pass but which now seems here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;" />
