  <title>Reflective Leaders and High-Performance Organizations - Nick A. Shepherd, Peter J. Smyth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An organization operating in the twenty-first century is different from one that operated during the Industrial Revolution. Todays focus is on optimizing human potential; people are the enablers of most aspects of intangible value. People develop relationships with suppliers, customers, distributors, and other third parties through which work is executed. In &lt;i&gt;Reflective Leaders and High-Performance Organizations&lt;/i&gt;, authors Nick Shepherd and Peter Smyth take an integrated view of organizational performance that blends a focus on both outcomes and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reflective Leaders and High-Performance Organizations&lt;/i&gt; suggests a framework for developing and applying an improved approach to organizational leadership and management. In addition to philosophy and conceptual approaches, it presents
tested practical tools and direction. It also delivers case studies of organizations that have applied Shepherds and Smyths ideas and realized measurable improvements in the day-to-day activities of the organization, along with measurably improved outcomes from the organizational activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using over twenty years of practical consulting experience as well as careers in management, Shepherd and Smyth demonstrate how effective leaders can maintain a focus on organizational tasks and outcomes and do this while building and enhancing human relationships.&lt;/p&gt;" />
