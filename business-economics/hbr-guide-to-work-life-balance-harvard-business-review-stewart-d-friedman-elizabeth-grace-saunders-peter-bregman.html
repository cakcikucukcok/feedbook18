  <title>HBR Guide to Work-Life Balance - Harvard Business Review, Stewart D. Friedman, Elizabeth Grace Saunders, Peter Bregman...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You can have it all. You can&#39;t have it all. Balance your work and your life. There is no balance. Prioritize! Manage your time!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so much conflicting advice and so many demands on your time, it&#39;s no wonder you feel overwhelmed by your commitments. No matter your age, your marital or parental status, or your profession, you juggle a lot. Work, home, family duties, volunteer activities, your own interests and mental health--every day you face the constant push and pull of a full life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But having a full life isn&#39;t a bad thing, and it doesn&#39;t have to be a constant source of stress. You&#39;ll never divide your time or attention evenly between all of your activities and commitments, but you can discover ways to make choices and trade-offs and feel less stressed about them. This guide brings together a variety of expert voices with a carefully selected set of ideas for managing all of your competing interests more effectively. You’ll learn how to:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make sustainable contributions to the most important areas of your life&lt;li&gt;Create a schedule that works for most everyone, most of the time&lt;li&gt;Understand the difference between must-do and to-do items on your list&lt;li&gt;Make time for yourself&lt;li&gt;Assuage feelings of guilt and failure&lt;li&gt;Ease the strain on your personal and professional relationships&lt;li&gt;Be present at home--and at work&lt;li&gt;Cope with unexpected gaps in child- or eldercare&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arm yourself with the advice you need to succeed on the job, from a source you trust. Packed with how-to essentials from leading experts, the HBR Guides provide smart answers to your most pressing work challenges.&lt;/p&gt;" />
