  <title>Powered by Principle - Amie J. Devero</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the course of six years of research and more than fifteen years of field work, Amie Devero has distinguished many of the key characteristics common to the thousands of organizations that maintain better than average results and ethical performance over the long term. What stood out was the degree to which they all use deep-seated core values for their decision-making and management. 
If you are a leader or a manager, an investor or a student, the tools and practices that are presented here will become indispensable. Powered by Principle not only explains why these types of organizations do so well, but provides a detailed, step by step guide for how to create this kind of dynamic and aligned organization. 
From the rationale to the exact type of process one should use to measure the expression of core values, every step is outlined here. Along the way, you will also gain knowledge of ways to develop your own thinking and mindset for this profound journey to become Principle-Powered. 
Regardless of your title, role or tenure, you will find a way to make your organization far better, and to make yourself better along the way. 
Olympic coach Indra Reinpuu shows how to live the dream. For many years Indra has shared his experience and knowledge with state and national League coaches of volleyball and netball, as well logging over 6000 one-on-one sessions as a personal trainer. He is a motivational speaker and the current South Australian Sports Institute Volleyball Development Coach." />
