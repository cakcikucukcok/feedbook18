  <title>PEAK - Chip Conley, Tony Hsieh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Proven principles for sustainable success, with new leadership insight&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;PEAK&lt;/i&gt; is the popular, transformative guide to doing business better, written by a seasoned entrepreneur/CEO who has disrupted his favorite industry not once, but twice. Author Chip Conley, founder and former CEO of one of the world’s largest boutique hotel companies, turned to psychologist Abraham Maslow&#39;s Hierarchy of Needs at a time when his company was in dire need. And years later, when the young founders of Airbnb asked him to help turn their start-up home sharing company into a world-class hospitality giant, Conley once again used the principles he’d developed in&lt;i&gt; PEAK.&lt;/i&gt; In the decade since this book&#39;s first edition, Conley&#39;s &lt;i&gt;PEAK&lt;/i&gt; strategy has been developed on six continents in organizations in virtually every industry. The author’s foundational premise is that great leaders become amateur psychologists by understanding the unique needs of three key relationships—with employees, customers, and investors—and this message has resonated with every kind of leader and company including some of the world’s best-known, from Apple to Facebook. Avid users of &lt;i&gt;PEAK&lt;/i&gt; have found that the principles create greater loyalty and differentiation with their key stakeholders. This new second edition includes in-depth examples of real-world &lt;i&gt;PEAK&lt;/i&gt; companies, including the author’s own at Airbnb, and exclusive &lt;i&gt;PEAK&lt;/i&gt; leadership practices that will take you—and your company&#39;s performance—to new heights.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether you&#39;re at a startup or a Fortune 500 company, at a for-profit, nonprofit, or governmental organization, this book can help you and your people reach potential you never realized you had.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Understand how Maslow&#39;s hierarchy makes for winning business practices&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Learn how &lt;i&gt;PEAK&lt;/i&gt; drove some of today&#39;s top businesses to success&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Help employees reach their full potential—and beyond&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Transform the customer experience and keep investors happy&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The PEAK framework succeeds because it elevates the business from the inside out. These same principles apply in the boardroom, the breakroom, and your living room at home, and have proven to be the foundation of healthy, fulfilled lives. Even if you think you&#39;re doing great, you could always be doing better—and &lt;i&gt;PEAK&lt;/i&gt; gives you a roadmap to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;" />
