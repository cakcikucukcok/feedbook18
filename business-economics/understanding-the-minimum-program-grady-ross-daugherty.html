  <title>Understanding the Minimum Program - Grady Ross Daugherty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Some of this content will be shocking. Its forthright presentation however is absolutely necessary, if the Left is to regroup around a corrected program, build a dynamic leadership party, and come to the rescue of endangered civilization. Economistic reformism has survived Lenin&#39;s crushing polemic, and has grown odiously and massively worldwide. For the better part of a century, it has allowed the survival and growth of monopoly-capitalism, in the United States and other countries. The present work is a salvo in our struggle to overcome the Economistic tendency, once and for all-as well as the pseudo-revolutionism of well-meaning ultra-Leftism. If we are successful, the possibility of an authentically socialist, cooperative social-capitalist United States will open in the near future, as well as the possibility of a peaceful and sustainable world of cooperative nations. Let&#39;s let the pamphlet speak for itself." />
