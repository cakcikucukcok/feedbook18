  <title>The Engagement Manifesto - R Alan Crozier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Alan Crozier has written an outstanding book on employee engagement in his &#39;manifesto.&#39; What makes it so good is his mix of leadership theory and personal practice distilled from years of client experience. &quot;The Engagement Manifesto&quot; is the best book I&#39;ve seen on this vital subject. Buy it and apply its wisdom.
               Roger DAprix, Managing Director, DAprix &amp; Co LLC, Author of The Credible Company
This is a very authoritative book. Anyone  particularly CEOs, HR professionals, brand marketing specialists, communications experts  serious about living the assertion that people are the definitive source of business success will find this book an invaluable source. 
Alan cuts through the hype, buzzwords and common misconceptions surrounding engagement. In doing so, he challenges the reader to make an honest re-assessment of their own understanding. He offers clear, practical advice about the what and the how if engagement is to have meaningful and lasting impact, and not go the way of so many other well intentioned business initiatives.
                                                            Jim Kennedy, Global VP Human Resources, Coopervision
This book is 24 carat gold. It is the one-minute-manager of engagement. 
I read it three times and learned something new each time. 
                                                                  Andrew Cooksey, Chief Executive, Jaggard Mackenzie
Well structured, joined-up thinking for business leaders highlighting the importance of the many facets of employee engagement - an ongoing journey not a destination.
