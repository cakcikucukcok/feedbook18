  <title>Six Billion Shoppers - Porter Erisman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An insightful, practical guide to e-commerce in emerging markets--and how to profit from their explosive boom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From China to India to Nigeria, e-commerce is entering a golden era in countries that were long left out of the e-commerce gold rush experienced in the West. If the story of the first twenty years of e-commerce&#39;s growth was set in developed markets, the story of the next twenty years will be set in emerging ones. The rise of e-commerce in emerging markets is being driven by three major trends: widespread internet adoption, a rising middle class, and, most importantly, innovative new business models that serve the needs of local customers better than the models used by western e-commerce giants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Six Billion Shoppers&lt;/i&gt; takes readers on an exciting and colorful journey around the world to visit the next e-commerce mega markets and explore how a new e-commerce boom is opening opportunities for entrepreneurs and global brands alike. Traveling through Nigeria, China, India, Southeast Asia, and Latin America, Porter Erisman addresses e-commerce across these new markets and what it means for western brands. He argues that e-commerce in developing countries is revolutionary and will play a much larger role in emerging markets than in the West. With e-commerce in emerging markets entering a rapid period of expansion, &lt;i&gt;Six Billion Shoppers&lt;/i&gt; explains how to seize the massive opportunity created by emerging market consumers and provides practical advice on how to ride this new business trend.&lt;/p&gt;" />
