  <title>Around the World in Eighty Wines - Mike Veseth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Inspired by Jules Verne&amp;rsquo;s classic adventure tale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Mike Veseth takes his readers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Around the World in Eighty Wines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; The journey starts in London, Phileas Fogg&amp;rsquo;s home base, and follows Fogg&amp;rsquo;s itinerary to France and Italy before veering off in search of compelling wine stories in Syria, Georgia, and Lebanon. Every glass of wine tells a story, and so each of the eighty wines must tell an important tale. We head back across Northern Africa to Algeria, once the world&amp;rsquo;s leading wine exporter, before hopping across the sea to Spain and Portugal. We follow Portuguese trade routes to Madeira and then South Africa with a short detour to taste Kenya&amp;rsquo;s most famous Pinot Noir. Kenya? Pinot Noir? Really!&lt;br /&gt;The route loops around, visiting Bali, Thailand, and India before heading north to China to visit Shangri-La. Shangri-La? Does that even exist? It does, and there is wine there. Then it is off to Australia, with a detour in Tasmania, which is so cool that it is hot. The stars of the Southern Cross (and the title of a familiar song) guide us to New Zealand, Chile, and Argentina. We ride a wine train in California and rendezvous with Planet Riesling in Seattle before getting into fast cars for a race across North America, collecting more wine as we go. Pause for lunch in Virginia to honor Thomas Jefferson, then it&amp;rsquo;s time to jet back to London to tally our wines and see what we have learned. &lt;br /&gt;Why these particular places? What are the eighty wines and what do they reveal? And what is the surprise plot twist that guarantees a happy ending for every wine lover? Come with us on a journey of discovery that will inspire, inform, and entertain anyone who loves travel, adventure, or wine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
