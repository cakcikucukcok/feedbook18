  <title>Ludicrous - Edward Niedermeyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tesla is the most exciting car company in a generation . . . but can it live up to the hype?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tesla Motors and CEO Elon Musk have become household names, shaking up the staid auto industry by creating a set of innovative electric vehicles that have wowed the marketplace and defied conventional wisdom. The company&amp;rsquo;s market valuation now rivals that of long-established automakers, and, to many industry observers, Tesla is defining the future of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But behind the hype, Tesla has some serious deficiencies that raise questions about its sky-high valuation, and even its ultimate survival. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla&amp;rsquo;s commitment to innovation has led it to reject the careful, zero-defects approach of other car manufacturers, even as it struggles to mass-produce cars reliably, and with minimal defects. While most car manufacturers struggle with the razor-thin margins of mid-priced sedans, Tesla&amp;rsquo;s strategy requires that the Model 3 finally bring it to profitability, even as the high-priced Roadster and Model S both lost money. And Tesla&amp;rsquo;s approach of continually focusing on the future, even as commitments and deadlines are repeatedly missed, may ultimately test the patience of all but its most devoted fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Ludicrous&lt;/em&gt;, journalist and auto industry analyst Edward Niedermeyer lays bare the disconnect between the popular perception of Tesla and the&amp;nbsp;day-to-day realities of the company&amp;mdash;and the cars it produces.&amp;nbsp;Blending original reporting and never-before-published insider accounts with savvy industry analysis, Niedermeyer tells the story of Tesla as it&amp;rsquo;s never been told before&amp;mdash;with clear eyes, objectivity and insight.&lt;/p&gt;" />
