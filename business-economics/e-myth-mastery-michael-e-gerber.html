  <title>E-Myth Mastery - Michael E. Gerber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The bestselling author of phenomenally successful and continually vital &lt;em&gt;The E-Myth Revisited&lt;/em&gt; presents the next big step in entrepreneurial management and leadership with &lt;em&gt;E-Myth Mastery&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A practical, real-world program that is implemented real-time into your business, Gerber begins by engaging the reader in understanding why the entrepreneur is so critical to the success of any enterprise, no matter how small or large it may be, and why the mindset of an entrepreneur is so integral to the operating reality of the organization, of the small business, and the enterprise. He then covers seven essential skills:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leadership&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Marketing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Money&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lead Conversion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lead Generation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Client Fulfilment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these seven skills is presented through a specific training module with corresponding tests and exercises that explain the content and principles to be learned, provide case studies and examples, as well as worksheets for applying those ideas to the business. Gerber ties it all together by helping readers put the pieces together in an E-Myth Business, an E-Myth Practice and an E-Myth Enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the book that will show you the difference between being an entrepreneur versus doing a job, how to get money when the bank won&#39;t give it to you, how to expand your customer base when big business moves in down the street, how to develop the best people when you can&#39;t afford to pay them competitive wages, how to increase the predictability of what your business is able to promise, and then how to keep that promise, every single time, no matter where you are or what you&#39;re doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mastery is a business development program that helps you turn your company into a world-class operation...into a turn-key money machine!&lt;/p&gt;" />
