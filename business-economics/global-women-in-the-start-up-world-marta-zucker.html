  <title>Global Women in the Start-up World - Marta Zucker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Global Women in the Startup World: Conversations in Silicon Valley&lt;/i&gt; is a selection of interview-driven stories told by the Polish female founders who successfully made it to Silicon Valley.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt; This book is written with the focus on female founders because although women are playing an increasingly important role in the technology and business worlds, they still face unique challenges and hurdles, which can be particularly acute in the fast-paced startup environment. The interviewees came from Poland to Silicon Valley and succeeded. They built their networks, followed their dreams, and mastered the art of running a global company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Silicon Valley can be intimidating but with this book as a guide one can navigate the most challenging aspects of being a woman in the startup world. The stories in the book also prove that foreign startup founders are welcome in Silicon Valley and can achieve global success. It doesn&#39;t matter what country you are from-you can build your startup in any country: some of the interviewees live and work in Poland, while others decided to move abroad.&lt;/p&gt;" />
