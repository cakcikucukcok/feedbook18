  <title>Exploring Great Leadership - R. Lynn Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Just like you dont have to be a CEO to be a great leader, you dont have to be a great leader to achieve personal success. ... I have said that income, wealth, position, and status are not measures of great leadership. They are not measures of personal success either. Personal success is achieved through honoring and respecting those around you (including family, friends, fellow employees, and others), always being ethical at work and in your personal life, channeling your motivation and desires toward specific career and personal goals (which are compatible with your mental being), and being willing to pay the price of achieving those goals through sacrifice and hard work. Those who do that will find their niche for success and achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another significant point I want to make is the importance of enthusiasm and a positive attitude to achieve that success, especially when things are not going exactly as you envisioned or planned, which will inevitably happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most leadership books share ten steps for success, five things to never forget, and other such formulas. Someone who wants to become a great leader must truly understand the psychology and practice of great leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leadership ability is obtained by having the necessary psychological makeup, knowing ones self, love of work, honoring others, personal sacrifice, and having fun in the workplace. Ignoring, minimizing, or mismanaging the human side of management creates suspicion, fear, and failure in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a practical look at leadership from the inside of an organization, and discover how to build positive and effective relationships. Whether youre a great leader striving to be better, someone wanting to be a great leader, or an individual seeking to achieve your personal and professional dreams in life, you can find the inspiration to accomplish your goals through Exploring Great Leadership.&lt;/p&gt;" />
