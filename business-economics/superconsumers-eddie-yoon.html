      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Pork dorks. Craftsters. American Girl fans. Despite their different tastes, these eclectic diehards have a lot in common: they&amp;#8217;re obsessed about a specific brand, product, or category. They pursue their passions with fervor, and they&amp;#8217;re extremely knowledgeable about the things they love. They aren&amp;#8217;t average consumers&amp;#151;they&amp;#8217;re superconsumers.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Although small in number, superconsumers can have an outsized impact on a company&amp;#8217;s bottom line. Representing 10% of total consumers, they can drive between 30% to 70% of sales, and they&amp;#8217;re usually willing to spend considerably more than the average consumer. And because they&amp;#8217;re so engaged and passionate, they can offer invaluable advice to managers looking to improve their products, change their business models, energize their cultures, and attract new customers.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In &lt;I&gt;Superconsumers&lt;/I&gt;, growth strategy expert Eddie Yoon lays out a simple but extremely effective framework that has helped companies of all types and sizes achieve more sustainable growth: he&amp;#8217;ll show you how to find, listen to, and engage with your most passionate and profitable consumers, and then tailor your decisions to meet their wants and needs. Along the way, he&amp;#8217;ll let you into the minds and homes of superconsumers of all kinds, revealing what makes them tick and why they&amp;#8217;re willing to spend so much more than other consumers.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rich with data and case studies of companies that have implemented superconsumer strategies with great success, &lt;I&gt;Superconsumers&lt;/I&gt; is a fun, practical, and inspiring guide for anyone interested in making their best customers even better.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
