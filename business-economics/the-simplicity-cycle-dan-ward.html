  <title>The Simplicity Cycle - Dan Ward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The award-winning engineer, Air Force lieutenant colonel, and author of &lt;em&gt;F.I.R.E&lt;/em&gt; offers a road map for designing winning new products, services, and business models, and shows how to avoid complexity-related pitfalls in the process.
