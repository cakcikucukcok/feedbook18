  <title>Transforming Relationships for High Performance - Jody Hoffer Gittell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Whether from customers, supply-chain partners, policymakers, or regulators, organizations in virtually every industry are facing calls to do more with less. They are feeling compelled to provide higher-quality outcomes, more rapidly, at a lower cost.
This book offers a road-tested approach for delivering these outcomes through positive organizational change. Its message comes just in time, for too many companies have gone the way of low-road strategies, such as cutting pay and perks, and working harder not smarter. Drawing on her path-breaking research, Jody Hoffer Gittell reveals that high performance is fundamentally relational—rooted in both human and social capital.
Based on this insight, she provides a unique model that will help companies to build meaningful relationships among colleagues, develop smarter work processes, and design organizational structures fit for today&#39;s pressure test. By following four organizations on their change journeys, she illustrates how &quot;relational coordination&quot; unfolds in real-world settings. Tools for change guide readers as they learn how to implement this new model in their own workplaces." />
