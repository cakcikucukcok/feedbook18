  <title>Collective Courage - Jessica Gordon Nembhard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Collective Courage&lt;/em&gt;, Jessica Gordon Nembhard chronicles African American cooperative business ownership and its place in the movements for Black civil rights and economic equality. Not since W. E. B. Du Bois&amp;rsquo;s 1907 &lt;em&gt;Economic Co-operation Among Negro Americans&lt;/em&gt; has there been a full-length, nationwide study of African American cooperatives. &lt;em&gt;Collective Courage&lt;/em&gt; extends that story into the twenty-first century. Many of the players are well known in the history of the African American experience: Du Bois, A. Philip Randolph and the Ladies&#39; Auxiliary to the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, Nannie Helen Burroughs, Fannie Lou Hamer, Ella Jo Baker, George Schuyler and the Young Negroes&amp;rsquo; Co-operative League, the Nation of Islam, and the Black Panther Party. Adding the cooperative movement to Black history results in a retelling of the African American experience, with an increased understanding of African American collective economic agency and grassroots economic organizing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To tell the story, Gordon Nembhard uses a variety of newspapers, period magazines, and journals; co-ops&amp;rsquo; articles of incorporation, minutes from annual meetings, newsletters, budgets, and income statements; and scholarly books, memoirs, and biographies. These sources reveal the achievements and challenges of Black co-ops, collective economic action, and social entrepreneurship. Gordon Nembhard finds that African Americans, as well as other people of color and low-income people, have benefitted greatly from cooperative ownership and democratic economic participation throughout the nation&amp;rsquo;s history. &lt;/p&gt;" />
