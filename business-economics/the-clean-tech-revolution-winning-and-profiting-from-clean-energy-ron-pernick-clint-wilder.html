  <title>The Clean Tech Revolution: Winning and Profiting from Clean Energy - Ron Pernick, Clint Wilder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When industry giants such as GE, Toyota, and Sharp and investment firms such as Goldman Sachs are making multibillion-dollar investments in clean technology, the message is clear. Developing clean technologies is no longer a social issue championed by environmentalists; it&#39;s a moneymaking enterprise moving solidly into the business mainstream. In fact, as the economy faces unprecedented challenges from high energy prices, resource shortages, and global environmental and security threats, clean tech&amp;#8212;technologies designed to provide superior performance at a lower cost while creating significantly less waste than conventional offerings&amp;#8212;promises to be the next engine of economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Clean Tech Revolution&lt;/em&gt;, authors Ron Pernick and Clint Wilder identify the major forces that have pushed clean tech from back-to-the-earth utopian dream to its current revolution among the inner circles of corporate boardrooms, on Wall Street trading floors, and in government offices around the globe. By highlighting eight major clean-tech sectors&amp;#8212;solar energy, wind power, biofuels and biomaterials, green buildings, personal transportation, the smart grid, mobile applications, and water filtration&amp;#8212;they uncover how investors, entrepreneurs, and individuals can profit from this next wave of technological innovation. Pernick and Wilder shine the spotlight on the winners among technologies, companies, and regions that are likely to reap the greatest benefits from clean tech&amp;#8212;and they show you why the time to act is now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Groundbreaking and authoritative, &lt;em&gt;The Clean Tech Revolution&lt;/em&gt; is the must-read book to understand and profit from the clean technologies that are reshaping our fast-changing world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
