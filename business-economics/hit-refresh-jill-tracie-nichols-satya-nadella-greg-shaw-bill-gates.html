  <title>Hit Refresh - Jill Tracie Nichols, Satya Nadella, Greg Shaw, Bill Gates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;At the core, &lt;em&gt;Hit Refresh,&lt;/em&gt; is about us humans and the unique quality we call empathy, which will become ever more valuable in a world where the torrent of technology will disrupt the status quo like never before.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; Satya Nadella from &lt;em&gt;Hit Refresh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Satya has charted a course for making the most of the opportunities created by technology while also facing up to the hard questions.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; Bill Gates from the Foreword of &lt;em&gt;Hit Refresh&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestseller &lt;em&gt;Hit Refresh&lt;/em&gt; is about individual change, about the transformation happening inside of Microsoft and the technology that will soon impact all of our lives&amp;#8212;the arrival of the most exciting and disruptive wave of technology humankind has experienced: artificial intelligence, mixed reality, and quantum computing. It&amp;#8217;s about how people, organizations, and societies can and must transform and &amp;#8220;hit refresh&amp;#8221; in their persistent quest for new energy, new ideas, and continued relevance and renewal.&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&amp;#8217;s CEO tells the inside story of the company&amp;#8217;s continuing transformation, tracing his own personal journey from a childhood in India to leading some of the most significant technological changes in the digital era. Satya Nadella explores a fascinating childhood before immigrating to the U.S. and how he learned to lead along the way. He then shares his meditations as a sitting CEO&amp;#8212;one who is mostly unknown following the brainy Bill Gates and energetic Steve Ballmer. He tells the inside story of how a company rediscovered its soul&amp;#8212;transforming everything from culture to their fiercely competitive landscape and industry partnerships. As much a humanist as engineer and executive, Nadella concludes with his vision for the coming wave of technology and by exploring the potential impact to society and delivering call to action for world leaders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Ideas excite me,&amp;#8221; Nadella explains. &amp;#8220;Empathy grounds and centers me.&amp;#8221; &lt;em&gt;Hit Refresh&lt;/em&gt; is a set of reflections, meditations, and recommendations presented as algorithms from a principled, deliberative leader searching for improvement&amp;#8212;for himself, for a storied company, and for society.&lt;/p&gt;" />
