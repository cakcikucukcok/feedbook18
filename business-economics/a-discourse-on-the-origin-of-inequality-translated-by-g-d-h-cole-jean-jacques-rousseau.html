  <title>A Discourse on the Origin of Inequality (Translated by G. D. H. Cole) - Jean-Jacques Rousseau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Genevan philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau was one of the most influential figures of the 18th century. His political philosophy has been pointed to as a major contributing factor in causing the French Revolution. Social and economic inequality has been a pervasive element of human existence for the entirety of recorded history. The causes of this inequality are principal to the discussion of political, legal, and economic theory. Rousseau acknowledges two primary forces that bring about inequality in the world. The first is that which arises from natural law. Given the fact that some men are more capable in both their desire and ability to produce wealth, it is only natural that some inequality will arise. Rousseau argued however that a greater inequality comes from a secondary cause, that which arises from the structural deficiencies of civil society. Central to &quot;A Discourse on on the Origin of Inequality&quot; is the idea that as civilizations have grown so has the power of the privileged to gain an unnatural advantage over the weaker members of society. As relevant today as when first written, the influence of Rousseau’s philosophy on the development of modern society cannot be overstated. This edition follows the translation of G. D. H. Cole and includes a biographical afterword." />
