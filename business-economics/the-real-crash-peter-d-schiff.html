  <title>The Real Crash - Peter D. Schiff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking everything&#39;s okay: the stock market is on the rise, jobs are growing, the worst of it is over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&#39;d be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Real Crash&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Peter D. Schiff argues that America is enjoying a government-inflated bubble, one that reality will explode . . . with disastrous consequences for the economy and for each of us. Schiff demonstrates how the infusion of billions of dollars of stimulus money has only dug a deeper hole: the United States government simply spends too much and does not collect enough money to pay its debts, and in the end, Americans from all walks of life will face a crushing consequence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re in hock to China, we can&#39;t afford the homes we own, and the entire premise of our currency--backed by the full faith and credit of the United States--is false. Our system is broken, Schiff says, and there are only two paths forward.  The one we&#39;re on now leads to a currency and sovereign debt crisis that will utterly destroy our economy and impoverish the vast majority of our citizens.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if we change course, the road ahead will be a bit rockier at first, but the final destination will be far more appealing.  If we want to avoid complete collapse, we must drastically reduce government spending--eliminate entire agencies, end costly foreign military escapades and focus only on national defense--and stop student loan or mortgage interest deductions, as well as drug wars and bank-and-business bailouts. We must also do what no politician or pundit has proposed: America should declare bankruptcy, restructure its debts, and reform our system from the ground up. &lt;br&gt;Persuasively argued and provocative, &lt;i&gt;The Real Crash&lt;/i&gt; explains how we got into this mess, how we might get out of it, and what happens if we don&#39;t. And, with wisdom born from having predicted the Crash of 2008, Peter Schiff explains how to protect yourself, your family, your money, and your country against what he predicts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
