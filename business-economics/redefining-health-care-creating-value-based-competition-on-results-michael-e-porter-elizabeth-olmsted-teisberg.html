  <title>Redefining Health Care: Creating Value-based Competition on Results - Michael E. Porter, Elizabeth Olmsted Teisberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;The U.S. health care system is in crisis. At stake are the quality of care for millions of Americans and the financial well-being of individuals and employers squeezed by skyrocketing premiums&amp;#8212;not to mention the stability of state and federal government budgets.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In Redefining Health Care, internationally renowned strategy expert Michael Porter and innovation expert Elizabeth Teisberg reveal the underlying&amp;#8212;and largely overlooked&amp;#8212;causes of the problem, and provide a powerful prescription for change. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The authors argue that competition currently takes place at the wrong level&amp;#8212;among health plans, networks, and hospitals&amp;#8212;rather than where it matters most, in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of specific health conditions. Participants in the system accumulate bargaining power and shift costs in a zero-sum competition, rather than creating value for patients. Based on an exhaustive study of the U.S. health care system, Redefining Health Care lays out a breakthrough framework for redefining the way competition in health care delivery takes place&amp;#8212;and unleashing stunning improvements in quality and efficiency. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With specific recommendations for hospitals, doctors, health plans, employers, and policy makers, this book shows how to move health care toward positive-sum competition that delivers lasting benefits for all.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
