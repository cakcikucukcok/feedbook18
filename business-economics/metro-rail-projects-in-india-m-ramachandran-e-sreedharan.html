  <title>Metro Rail Projects in India - M. Ramachandran, E. Sreedharan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Taking stock of the urban transport scenario in Indian cities, this is the first full-length study of the metro rail system in India. In recent times the metro rail has come up as a favoured alternative of mass transport in urban spaces faced with growing population, heightened vehicular traffic, and increased pollution. Using data, analysis, and first-hand information, this book tells the story of metro rail as proposed and undertaken across Indiafrom Kolkata in the east and Mumbai in the west to Delhi and Jaipur in the north and Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Kochi in the south. Focusing on the complexities of project planning and contrasting the Indian experience with those of its global counterparts, this volume distils important lessons for future infrastructure projects. While the metro rail system has considerably improved inter-city connectivity, the metro story in India is an ongoing one. With a Foreword by E. Sreedharan setting the stage, this volume will appeal to anybody keen to know more about urban transport in India, as well as policymakers, management professionals, and students and researchers of economics and business studies." />
