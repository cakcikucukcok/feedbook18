  <title>Cracking the China Conundrum - Yukon Huang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="China&#39;s rise is altering global power relations, reshaping economic debates, and commanding tremendous public attention. Despite extensive media and academic scrutiny, the conventional wisdom about China&#39;s economy is often wrong. &lt;em&gt;Cracking the China Conundrum&lt;/em&gt; provides a holistic and contrarian view of China&#39;s major economic, political, and foreign policy issues.
Yukon Huang trenchantly addresses widely accepted yet misguided views in the analysis of China&#39;s economy. He examines arguments about the causes and effects of China&#39;s possible debt and property market bubbles, trade and investment relations with the Western world, the links between corruption and political liberalization in a growing economy and Beijing&#39;s more assertive foreign policies. Huang explains that such misconceptions arise in part because China&#39;s economic system is unprecedented in many ways-namely because it&#39;s driven by both the market and state- which complicates the task of designing accurate and adaptable analysis and research. Further, China&#39;s size, regional diversity, and uniquely decentralized administrative system poses difficulties for making generalizations and comparisons from micro to macro levels when trying to interpret China&#39;s economic state accurately.
This book not only interprets the ideologies that experts continue building misguided theories upon, but also examines the contributing factors to this puzzle.  &lt;em&gt;Cracking the China Conundrum&lt;/em&gt; provides an enlightening and corrective viewpoint on several major economic and political foreign policy concerns currently shaping China&#39;s economic environment." />
