  <title>An Uncommon Life - Moid U Ahmad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story of Suhanto is a social drama about his friends and their journey involves an acute display of emotions, relationships and imperative intricacies of a common life in a country like India. The main protagonist in the story is Suhanto and primarily the story revolves around him and covers integral aspects of human life such as friendship, struggle, success, defeat, giving back, compromises, inter personal relationships and culmination of life. 
  The story involves different shades of a common life as it unfolds. It brings forth some of the imperatives challenges of a human life at micro and macro level and even tries to provide for some answers. The geographic setting of the novel is urban but important characters from rural and western world are also highlighted. 
    The novel would appeal to young readers as they can relate to most of the content. Whether it is the description of a village ambience or a person&#39;s struggle to adapt urban culture, the young generation would like it. Also, there are segments in the novel for people in other phases of life, to which they can also relate. The most important feature of the novel is the inclusion of the concept of giving back to the society which can be related to masses. 
  It is a pure work of fiction with traces of business fiction. The story unfolds in the form of narration of past events and some conversations are depicted in the present times. The book is written in a very simple language using commonly used jargon and few local terms and thus will be a literary treat to read and enjoy." />
