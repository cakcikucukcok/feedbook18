  <title>Winning Every Day - Lou Holtz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;#34;Your talent determines what you can do. Your motivation determines how much you are willing to do. Your attitude determines how well you do it.&amp;#34;&lt;/remark&gt;&lt;div align=right&gt;&lt;by&gt;-- Lou Holtz&lt;/by&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet Lou Holtz, the motivational miracle worker who revitalized the Notre Dame football program by leading the legendary Fighting Irish to nine bowl games and a national championship. During his twenty-seven years as a head football coach, Holtz garnered a 216-95-7 career record. Each new assignment brought a different team with different players, but, invariably, the same result--success. How did he do it? By designing a game plan for his players that minimized obstacles while maximizing opportunities. &lt;p&gt;Now he wants to pass his game plan on to you. In &lt;em&gt;Winning Every Day,&lt;/em&gt; you&#39;ll discover ten strategies that will drive you to the top of your professional and personal life. Coach Holtz will reveal how you can acquire the focus and commitment it takes to be a champion. It won&#39;t be easy; it takes sacrifice to be the best. But now you&#39;ll have a proven winner alongside you in the trenches. &lt;em&gt;Winning Every Day&lt;/em&gt; demonstrates how you can elevate your performance while raising the standards of everyone around you. Follow Coach&#39;s strategies and winning becomes habitual. You will learn to welcome sacrifice as you dedicate yourself to excellence. He will show you how to clearly define your short-term and long-term goals, to develop an unwavering sense of purpose without compromising flexibility. &lt;p&gt;Through it all, Coach Holtz will help you discover the courage you need to live a life of unremitting triumph. You couldn&#39;t have a better guide. He will provide you with the strategies he has shared with Fortune 500 companies, groups, and organizations. Voted the top motivational speaker two years running by a survey of speakers&#39; bureaus, Coach is going to present you with all the Xs and Os, the basics of his game plan for success in life and business. &lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/center&gt;" />
