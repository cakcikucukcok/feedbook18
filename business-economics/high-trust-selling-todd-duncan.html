  <title>High Trust Selling - Todd Duncan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Do you feel like your career exists somewhere between your last sale and your next one? Are you always searching for the way to bridge the gap and create long-term success? Does it seem that somehow your life is only about your ability to perform on the job?&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;For too long you have bought into the idea that the business you do and the life you lead are completely separate. What Todd Duncan has learned in his twenty-two years of sales is the polar opposite: When you discover how to connect who you are and what you are about in your selling career, the results will be phenomenal and long-lasting.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;No matter what industry you work in or what type of sales position you hold, adopting the practical principles in &lt;I&gt;High Trust Selling&lt;/I&gt; will open the door to a new way of thinking and a life beyond your wildest expectations.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;“Long-term sales success happens when high trust exists—when you are a trustworthy salesperson running a trustworthy sales business, and when it’s clear to your clients that you are a person of integrity who will not only do what you say but who also has the means to deliver.” —Todd Duncan&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;" />
