      <meta name="description" content="I Can: How to Believe in Yourself and Your Ability Using Powerful Affirmations, messages and quotes.  Empower yourself to take charge of your life and fulfil your dreams even if they say you can&#39;t.  When they say you can&#39;t, show them you can.    When I failed at something, my beloved mother would tell me to try again and say wisely, that it is when we fall down, we get up.  My parents were very encouraging and would always support me in whatever I wanted to do even when the world was telling me that I couldn&#39;t do it.  I am very grateful to have had such a good foundation.  This book is written for those who are less fortunate.  Not everyone gets encouragement and support or a loving, supportive family.  I have collected some of my favourite sayings and affirmations that could help to empower you.  Sometimes, it&#39;s the simplest words or phrases that have the most impact.
