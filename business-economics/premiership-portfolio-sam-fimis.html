      <meta name="description" content="The first-ever publication to combine the AFL and the ASX under the one cover. Premiership Portfolio is a six-step guide to learning how to succeed in the Australian sharemarket, using footballing analogies to explain the concepts and the strategy. Investing in the sharemarket isn&#39;t a game, yet the common denominators between the AFL and ASX are many:Results are everything: Both the AFL and investing in the sharemarket are results-driven. There is no sure thing: Despite what any one-eyed supporter or share tipster will tell you, there is no sure thing in football or investments. Talent: Winning premierships requires recruiting talented players and outperforming the market requires picking talented shares. Diversification: Share portfolios need diversification to reduce risk. 18 forwards don&#39;t take to the field on game day for good reason. Hard work: Hard work is essential to achieving goals in life, especially your financial goals. It&#39;s all subjective: My opinion of a company may differ from your opinion, and your opinion of a player may differ from mine. Process: Your level of success in either will depend on your preparation and how thorough your process is." />
