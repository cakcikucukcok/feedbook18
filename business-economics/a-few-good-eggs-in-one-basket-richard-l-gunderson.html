  <title>A Few Good Eggs in One Basket - Richard L. Gunderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a stock market environment dominated by professional investors, &lt;i&gt;A Few Good Eggs in One Basket&lt;/i&gt; o?ers a plain-talk approach to pro?tability by selecting and managing an investment portfolio of common stocks for an individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Richard L. Gunderson, who has been an investor for more than forty years, outlines an enduring framework that improves the odds for the individual investor to exceed the performance of the market over the long term by buying good companies at bargain prices. He outlines what constitutes a good company and how to determine when a price meets the test of being a bargain. &lt;i&gt;A Few Good Eggs in One Basket&lt;/i&gt; also helps individual investors by discussing&lt;br&gt;
what to look for;
where to look;
when to buy;
when to sell; and
how many stocks to own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Few Good Eggs in One Basket&lt;/i&gt; presents a prescription designed to take advantage of opportunities created by market overreaction to bad news and disappointing results. Gunderson believes there are always bargains at any time and in any market. The challenge is to consistently apply a disciplined approach to identifying the unusual and favorable opportunities and concentrating a portfolio on those stocks representing the best combination of overall quality and intrinsic value.&lt;/p&gt;" />
