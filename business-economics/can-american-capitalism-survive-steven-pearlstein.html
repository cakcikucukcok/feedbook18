  <title>Can American Capitalism Survive? - Steven Pearlstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;If anyone can save capitalism from the capitalists, it&#39;s Steven Pearlstein. This lucid, brilliant book refuses to abandon capitalism to those who believe morality and justice irrelevant to an economic system.&quot; --Ezra Klein, founder and editor-at-large, Vox&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pulitzer Prize-winning economics journalist Steven Pearlstein argues that our thirty year experiment in unfettered markets has undermined core values required to make capitalism and democracy work.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;With a New Introduction by the Author&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thirty years ago, &quot;greed is good&quot; and &quot;maximizing shareholder value&quot; became the new mantras woven into the fabric of our business culture, economy, and politics. Although, around the world, free market capitalism has lifted more than a billion people from poverty, in the United States most of the benefits of economic growth have been captured by the richest 10%, along with providing justification for squeezing workers, cheating customers, avoiding taxes, and leaving communities in the lurch. As a result, Americans are losing faith that a free market economy is the best system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Moral Capitalism&lt;/i&gt;, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Steven Pearlstein chronicles our descent and challenges the theories being taught in business schools and exercised in boardrooms around the country. We&#39;re missing a key tenet of Adam Smith&#39;s wealth of nations: without trust and social capital, democratic capitalism cannot survive. Further, equality of incomes and opportunity need not come at the expense of economic growth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pearlstein lays out bold steps we can take as a country: a guaranteed minimum income paired with universal national service, tax incentives for companies to share profits with workers, ending class segregation in public education, and restoring competition to markets. He provides a path forward that will create the shared prosperity that will sustain capitalism over the long term.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Previously published as &lt;i&gt;Can American Capitalism Survive?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
