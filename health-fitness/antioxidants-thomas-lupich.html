  <title>Antioxidants - Thomas Lupich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;ANTIOXIDANTS: MIGHTY CANCER WEAPONS describes how large quantities of antioxidants (AOs) can benefit cancer patients of both orthodox and alternative oncology. It explains how and why a super abundance of AOs are able to create an inhospitable terrain for the cancer cells, with a potential for their demise. It speaks of cancer prevention, how AOs positively affect blood flow, how they alkalize the body, hydrate cells, attract oxygen into the cells, enhance the conductivity of bodily fluids, strengthen the immune system, etc. It also explains some aspects of the cancer process, which readers should find interesting, while suggesting the use of certain powerful AOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When his wife was diagnosed with cancer years ago, he found himself on a quest to find the best treatments for her. Even after she passed away, he continued studying. His research and strong interest in health and healing approaches gave him greater insights into the world of alternative health and healing. Lupich recognized the usefulness of powerful antioxidants to cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His discovery was reinforced by an incident that happened about year ago. A member of his family who had metastatic breast cancer for more than eight years and brain cancer for about one year decided to increase her intake of high potency AOs. She did so with other supplements for six months. At the end of that period she was found to be cancer free. Her doctors were flabbergasted at the remission of her cancer. This experience motivated Lupich to write his book and expound on the benefits of high potency AOs. &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: line-through;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groundbreaking and informative, ANTIOXIDANTS is filled with practical insights and alternative solutions that offer a new beam of hope to cancer patients and their families.&lt;/p&gt;" />
