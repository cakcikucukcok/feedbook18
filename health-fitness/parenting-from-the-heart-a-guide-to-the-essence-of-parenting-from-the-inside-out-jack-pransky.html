  <title>Parenting from the Heart: A Guide to the Essence of Parenting from the Inside-Out - Jack Pransky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Just when you thought you&#39;ve heard it all-&lt;i&gt;Parenting from the Heart&lt;/i&gt; offers a new and different, refreshing approach to parenting.  This easy-to-understand, down-to-earth book moves beyond parenting theories and techniques to get to the heart of parenting. If parents know how to look within their hearts to find the answers they need, parenting techniques are not necessary. If parents know how to find a loving connection with their children at most times, discipline and consequences are rarely necessary. All parents have it within them to bring out the best in their children. Approaching parents in this way makes parenting a true pleasure instead of the battle and chore it often becomes. Many so-called experts say that raising kids is the toughest job any of us will ever do, but it does not have to be that way. It can be the most joyful thing any of us will ever do. &lt;i&gt;Parenting from the Heart&lt;/i&gt; is a must resource for anyone who cares about parenting and raising children.   &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Jack Pransky, Ph.D. is Director of the &lt;i&gt;Center for Inside-Out Understanding&lt;/i&gt; and is an international consultant and trainer for the prevention of problem behaviors and the promotion of well-being. He also authored the books, &lt;i&gt;Somebody Should Have Told Us!; Modello: A Story of Hope for the Inner-City and Beyond; Prevention from the Inside-Out, Prevention: The Critical Need&lt;/i&gt; and co-authored both the &lt;i&gt;Healthy Thinking, Feeling, Doing--from the Inside-Out&lt;/i&gt; curriculum and guide for middle school students and &lt;i&gt;What Is A Thought (A Thought Is A Lot)&lt;/i&gt;, a picture book for little children. Pransky has worked in the field of prevention since 1968 in a wide variety of capacities. He has offered parenting training and consultation to a great number of parents, and has trained many parenting course instructors." />
