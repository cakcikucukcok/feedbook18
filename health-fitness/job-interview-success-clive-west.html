  <title>Job Interview Success - Clive West</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you struggle at job interviews?&amp;nbsp; If you &amp;quot;interview badly&amp;quot;, that could be preventing you from getting a desperately-needed paying position - or nailing that Dream Job. This book contains excellent advice from an expert in the field, that could help you ace those difficult interviews and win&amp;nbsp; the job you deserve.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Have you blown jobs because the interview has gone in a direction you weren&amp;#39;t prepared for?&lt;br /&gt;
Do you find yourself sitting passively by while the interviewer runs the show?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What if someone told you that there were six simple stages to taking control of the interview away from the interviewer and putting it fairly and squarely in your hands - all without acting out any form of aggressive posturing? In fact, it&amp;#39;s so simple that anyone can do it, irrespective of how assertive they might be.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Best of all, once you have the interview under control, you can lead it in the direction which suits you, making you the favorite for the job.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In an employment climate where an outlandish number of people are applying for every single job, it makes sense to do everything you can to stack the odds in your favor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book explains in clear, accessible language, liberally seasoned with humor, exactly how to do just that.&lt;br /&gt;
