      <meta name="description" content="The subject and objective for you of this book  Getting the best for your health after health  issues
Are you feeling below par, not satisfied with how some or many parts of your health are progressing? 
Here in this Autobiography is the answer for what worked for me, and how you to can lift your wellbeing to a better level of health by applying these sane simple answers for yourself.
If you are one of the many people who over time are feeling down and disillusioned by an ongoing mediocre feeling of wellbeing then here is your answer and guide to help you lift yourself to a better level of health and enjoyment of life.  
There are a host of helpful guiding points though the book both for people who are having issues and looking for answers and who are not regular users of prescription drugs. Plus if you are a regular prescribed medication user then there are more answers with natural ways for you to help build your wellbeing to more desirable levels. Read on! 
Prescription medications and their subtle side effects have been a part of my life experience since 2001, when I was fitted with an artificial heart valve. Following that surgery, the constant use of prescribed drugs, has for me and can and does over time for many users have a real negative effect on ones general vitality and sense of wellbeing, because of their acid effect on the body. This low acid effect puts you out of balance from our bodys ideal acid/alkaline balance.  The medical establishment tells us nothing about how to help cope with this effect or even admit it exists. 
For the next nine years after 2001, life for me went through this constant rollercoaster of feeling OK  at times to awful, from near healthy to Flue, Depression, and Lethargic, never properly healthy.  If there was some sort of bug going around, it was sure to affect me!  Almost monthly I was at a Doctor seeking an answer to my unhealthy issues!  It has taken TEN YEARS for me to work out the root causes of my below normal health issues, and then apply this learning to dramatically better my health and vitality! 
Through this book you will find a whole host of major and minor pointers to guide you onto a better path of healthy and holistic living. When you combine this knowledge with your required daily intake of prescribed medicine, you will find a real and sustained lift to your overall health and wellbeing. The solutions are simple, natural and relatively inexpensive. Action by you is the real way to get results! 
 Heres your opportunity to apply this learning to your life over the next TEN WEEKS and know what it feels like to be and feel really healthier again!" />
