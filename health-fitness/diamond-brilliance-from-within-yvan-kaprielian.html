  <title>Diamond Brilliance from Within - Yvan Kaprielian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Yvan was challenged with lots of uncertainty in his life, but there is one thing hes always known - He loves diamonds. He loves educating about them, loves sharing his passion for them, and loves contemplating their beauty. But he was determined to understand exactly why hes so passionate about them.
He seeks the answer to that question in the first volume of Diamond Brilliance from Within, examining the diamonds value and origins and how this relates to human value, perseverance, and potential.
He writes, They are, in fact, symbols of our lives. I strongly believe that diamonds are an exact representation of our lives. Diamonds are messages from Mother Earth to human beings. But thats just the tip of the iceberg.
Diamonds, he writes, are more than symbols of financial and social status. Rather, they are a message from a higher spiritual power, and there is a direct correlation between the reflection of light inside a diamond and an individuals internal thoughts.
Join the author as he embarks on a brave journey from the depths of the earth to unveil what diamonds can teach us about the essence of our Self, our Soul, heart, body and mind." />
