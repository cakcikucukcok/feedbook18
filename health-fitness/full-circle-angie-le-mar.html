  <title>Full Circle - Angie Le Mar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Multi-award winning comedienne Angie Le Mar tells us what makes her tick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffering from dyslexia, exclusion from school, pioneering in the field of comedy. &amp;quot;I am what dreams are made of.&amp;quot; Yes, that little black girl from Lewisham!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I knew from a young child I had something important to do in the world, and that was to share the gift of laughter.&amp;quot; Respected in the field of comedy, TV and theatre, as a radio and TV talk show host, Angie has created a formidable career in a difficult industry.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Celebrating over 30 years in the entertainment business at 51 years old, we hear about her journey. Angie Le Mar is a pioneer; she has triumphantly beaten the odds, achieving great successes, but with highs and lows, facing rejection, suffered life-threatening illness, but still believed that God had a plan for her. Little did she know He would bring her Full Circle.&lt;/p&gt;" />
