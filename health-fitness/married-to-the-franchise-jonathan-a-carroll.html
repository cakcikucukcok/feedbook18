  <title>Married to the Franchise - Jonathan A. Carroll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jonathan Carroll married Nkechi Okoro when he was twenty-five years old, after an eighteen-month courtship. He knew that Nkechi was a franchise player who would lead him to a championship life from the moment they first met in college five years earlier. More than ten years after saying I do, she has more than delivered. In modern society, Jonathan and Nkechis relationship and rise into a marriage of champions seems like a rare occurrence. However, the truth is that there are similar couples from all walks of life who manage to maintain a committed bond while striving to be the best they can be. Married to the Franchise chronicles both Jonathans road to being in a position as a relationship owner where he could partner with a woman of Nkechis caliber, as well as the journeys of other men who found franchise players with whom to share a life. It explores the ways that these couples manage to keep walking side by side through financial ups and downs, career changes, and family expansion." />
