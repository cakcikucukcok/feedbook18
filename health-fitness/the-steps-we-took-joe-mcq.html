      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The words of this book&#39;s title are said aloud every day by thousands of people meeting together to help each other recover from addiction.s the addictions may be to alcohol or cocaine, gambling or food, violence or sex, but the path to recovery is the same.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The exciting thing about the Twelve Steps is that they teach us how to live. Once we know the design of living and the principles of living a successful life, we find that we not only get over the problems we see, but we avoid many other problems we would have had. To me, the miracle is that all this was boiled down into twelve simple Steps that anybody can apply.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is a book of plain-spoken wisdom for people with addictions and people who love them. Joe McQ has been a student of the Twelve Steps for more than three decades. He, like tens of thousands of others, lives them every day, one day at a time. In The Steps We Took, Joe takes us through them, one Step at a time, and helps us understand how they work-and how they can change our lives. &lt;/p&gt;" />
