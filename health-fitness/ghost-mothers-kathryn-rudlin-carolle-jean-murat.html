  <title>Ghost Mothers - Kathryn Rudlin, Carolle Jean-Murat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;ARE YOU HAUNTED by your past, unable to be the person you long to be?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The core cause of your emotional, physical or spiritual problems may be unresolved issues from being raised by a GHOST MOTHER. Ghost mothers are unable to connect emotionally. You needed so much from her, and got so little. Now this reality keeps you from becoming the empowered woman you want to be. Illuminating the ghost-issues that keep you stuck will immediately help you to move beyond the pain of your past.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Based on the authors healing journey, and the haunting stories of other ghost daughters, this book explores the impact of an illusive past, and provides healing strategies for embracing a visible life. LEARN the 6 proven ghost-busting strategies to create a life in which you are no longer haunted by the pain of being raised by a ghost mother.&lt;/p&gt;
RECOGNIZE: the reality of your past and what your ghost mother couldnt provide. 
RELEASE: the pain that creates negative emotions, and damages your spirit. 
REFOCUS: on a strong identity that allows you to get your needs met. 
RESTORE: your confidence, emotional strength, and self-knowledge.
RENOVATE: your perception of yourself in powerful ways.
REWRITE: a new life-script using the hidden gifts of being raised by a ghost." />
