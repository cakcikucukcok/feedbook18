  <title>Mind Shift - Don Sweatt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book attempts to address the subject of physical training as it relates to health and fitness from a both philosophical and pedagogical perspective. In that, the current popularization of fitness seems at odds with its original intent; which was the cultivation of the mind-body and spirit ( an internal manifestation of intent) through the systematic practice of a discipline such as yoga, martial arts, gymnastics or dance or a training program specifically designed to prepare an athlete for sports participation-track and field, basketball, football, etc., which required the participant to have mastered the basic physical prerequisites-good posture, balance, coordination, agility, suppleness, command of basic calisthenics, and kinesthetic awareness, necessary for high levels of performance while minimizing the risk of injuries.
This books premise is about making a mind shift from the current definition and practice of physical fitness as portrayed by many popular fitness media personalities, health and fitness magazines and many big box health clubs, to one in which the acquisition of physical fitness is likened to the study of the martial arts where one follows the path, or commonly referred as the way or (Dao).
The characters depicted in the book, though their backgrounds may differ, follow a physical fitness similar in fashion. A regimen that owes much of its origin to ancient Chinese martial arts, calisthenics (body weight training) propagated by the ancient Greek athletes and the physical cultural movement of the mid 1800s to early 1900s that took place here in the United States and in parts of Europe. 
The aforementioned had a common philosophy. And that was physical training, whether for the purely aesthetic, muscular strength, athletics, or general good health, should be systematic, progressive, efficient, and most important work. In other words, progress that is validated through observation-well coordinated fluid movements, better stability (balance), improved posture and aesthetics. And measurable-able to successfully perform a series of basic strength to body weight tests: pull ups, dips, push-ups, sprints with perfect form. 
Hopefully, in some small way, the stories in this book about characters striving to achieve physical mastery of a discipline or engaging in a challenging free form of movement for the sheer delight of it, will give the reader pause the next time he or she hears about the latest exercise gimmick or gizmo or the next must have fitness celebrities workout DVD.
And maybe, just maybe, theyd be on the verge of a mind shift." />
