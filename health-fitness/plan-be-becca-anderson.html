  <title>Plan Be! - Becca Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The affirmations, quotes and ideas in this book are a set of tools for you to use in your self-development. They are for “inner work.” And, you know what they say about happiness, that it’s an “inside job,” which is 100% true. These suggestions vary widely from spiritual aspirations to very simple, straightforward and  practical ideas. Much has to do with adjusting your attitude. Depending on the day, it might be a slight adjustment or a major overhaul but the more you practice daily affirmations, the fewer adjustments you’ll need. One day,  you will realize you have mastered the art of “thinking happy” and are looking at the bright side of life, every day.  Incorporating this as a daily practice will build “mental muscle” and help you achieve the all-important optimistic way of thinking. 
I very much like the idea of idea of undertaking the inner work of self-development and working your way to a better you. I am also a strong advocate for believing in yourself and loving yourself more each and every day. These are habits that can easily be reinforced by practices such as journaling, creating your own affirmations and talking to yourself in the positive. 
Like an engine driving you toward greater things, self belief brings you closers to your life’s purpose, your personal mission and will absolutely make you a happier camper. Daily affirmations help build the optimistic mindset. So, try it. Easy as pie and just as sweet." />
