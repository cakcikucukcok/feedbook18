  <title>Assisted Living: Everything you need to know to compassionately care for your elderly parent - Davis Zavik</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I wrote this book for the person whose loved one requires additional assistance in searching for a place to live out their golden years. Whether they are your parent, partner, or sibling, know that you&amp;rsquo;re not alone in your search. This book will be a useful tool that you can carry with you and gather information you need to make well-informed and wise decisions with or on behalf of your loved one when searching for an assisted living facility. Currently, there are more than forty million caregivers in the U.S. who are folks just like you who wish to assist but don&amp;rsquo;t have an understanding that is needed for managing elderly health challenges. Three main options for elderly individuals and their families include in-home care agencies, assisted living facilities, and nursing homes. It makes sense to most people that nursing homes, with their more intensive levels of care, cost more than assisted living. What many don&amp;rsquo;t realize is that the elder care costs associated with home care can quickly outpace the costs of assisted living as well. Home care agencies typically charge by the hour, meaning it will depend on how much care is needed, but the expenses can add up quickly for anyone who needs extensive care. In this book, we&amp;rsquo;ll be focusing solely on assisted living facilities, although I wanted to explain how ALF&amp;rsquo;s relate to the other options so you can make the best decision possible. In this book, I share with you the questions I initially needed answers to, as well as the ones I added to my list as I learned more along the way. So, it&amp;#39;s my hope that after reading you should have a comprehensive understanding of what to look for, what to look out for and the right questions to ask facility administrators when looking for a place for your elderly family members. Time is the only thing on this planet that we can&amp;#39;t get more of, so use this book as a resource to help collapse time frames from my education and experience to help you find the best care for your loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;" />
