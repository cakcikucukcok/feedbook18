  <title>Dear Daughter - Wil LaVeist</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After 20-plus years of marriage and parenting, popular radio host, professor and author Wil LaVeist uncovered a family secret that dropped him and his adult daughter to their knees.&lt;/strong&gt; A chance DNA test revealed that his &amp;ldquo;daddy&amp;rsquo;s girl&amp;rdquo; is not his biological child. LaVeist instead focused on the future, confronting the root cause that led to this tremendous pain and his daughter&amp;rsquo;s resentment as she tries to cope with the truth. &lt;em&gt;Dear Daughter&lt;/em&gt; is his love letter from a dad to his daughter, and to all women who&amp;rsquo;ve had broken relationships with their fathers that often lead to reckless choices that cause great pain. In this, ironically, pro-marriage work, LaVeist weaves the advice of experts with storytelling &amp;ndash; including his own journey ending in divorce court, revealing the damaging flaws of paternity laws. He bridges the &amp;ldquo;deadbeat dads&amp;rdquo; gap, delivering transparent provocative dialogue on love, pain, healing and the law that good dad&amp;rsquo;s share, but that many women miss when their fathers are absent or dysfunctional. &lt;em&gt;Dear Daughter&lt;/em&gt; will appeal to women who are considering marriage and parenting, but also anyone who desires healthy long-term love relationships.&lt;/p&gt;" />
