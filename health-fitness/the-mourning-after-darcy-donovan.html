  <title>The Mourning After - Darcy Donovan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On January 29, 2010, James Donovan went in to the hospital for a simple Day procedure; it was supposed to be &quot;in and out&quot;, just like that... It didn&#39;t turn out that way. His son, Darcy Donovan, walks you through a deeply personal and painful journey after witnessing his father succumb to the medical mistake. He offers to walk you through his personal journey of the sudden loss of his father and how he successfully - and unsuccessfully - navigated the road of death, grief, and healing in its wake. From dealing with bitterness and anger that followed, to a hauntingly beautiful message at the end, the tale is a raw and honest look at the nature of grief. For, when a loved one dies, the event changes you as a person forever. But, you&#39;ll come to realize, this isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing." />
