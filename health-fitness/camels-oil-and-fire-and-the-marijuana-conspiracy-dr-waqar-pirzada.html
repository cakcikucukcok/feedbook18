  <title>Camels, Oil, and Fire and the Marijuana Conspiracy - Dr. Waqar Pirzada</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Marijuana is a leading drug threat to the country (USA).
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) in a report prepared by the Federal Research Division, Library of Congress, 2003.
         In the recent years, marijuana (weed) has gained tremendous popularity in the American public, and the media is creating hype on its beneficial uses medical or recreational. The marijuana traders and growers have started making huge profits, and it is becoming a prolific industry. The marijuana growers have devised multiple ways to cross-seed various varieties and have made weed in a more potent forms available than before. Arent the days sooner when school-going children may have marijuana cookies, gums, and candies for breakfast and school lunch?
How about cigarette companies add a blend of marijuana along with tobacco and advertise as mild, light, and strong blends. There will be a boom in the tobacco industry, and smokers will have already made out cigarettes for smokers that are blended with marijuana at their local stores alongside other regular tobacco products. Are we going to make all America a smoking heaven for marijuana and years later think that we might have gone too far in promoting marijuana, so start banning this menace?" />
