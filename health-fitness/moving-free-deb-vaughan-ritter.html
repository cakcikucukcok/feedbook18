  <title>Moving Free - Deb Vaughan Ritter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Inspired by her mothers final declaration that she must move free, Deb Vaughan Ritter embarked on a remarkable journey of awakening. She felt compelled to share what she had learned in order to illuminate others paths.
Utilizing the metaphor of a challenging mountain hike, Deb fearlessly chronicles her trek and guides you on your own ascending journey with her poignant and humorous stories, original poetry and mantras, and sage advice. She encourages you to explore your life and integrate into it the mysteries of moving free.
The grounded yet uplifting tenets in this book are accessible to all, whatever your age, stage in life, or belief system. Deb writes in a way that meets you where you are without judgment and urges you to move free right here, right now.
As you join her on this trail, you will learn to navigate your challenges with courage and hope, ascend towards your personal peaks, and enjoy your daily hike. As you absorb these principles into your life, youll gradually begin spiraling up toward the life, relationships, and career of your dreams.
For years, I tried to go under, over and around the nagging issues I was experiencing in my life. The same issues kept showing up. I felt trapped under a very dark cloud in the personal, financial, career and relationship aspects of my life. The one common denominator was me. With Debs coaching, insights, mantras, poems and patient encouragement, I learned to face my issues with peace and hope. As a result, I have changed my life dramatically! As my outlook, actions, and expectations improved, I began manifesting better outcomes and relationships. I began feeling more peaceful and free. With Debs guidance, you too can begin moving free. No matter what your current circumstances, if you are willing to learn and grow, her light and insights will transform you, allowing you to reach new heights.   Stacie Tindle, Coaching Client" />
