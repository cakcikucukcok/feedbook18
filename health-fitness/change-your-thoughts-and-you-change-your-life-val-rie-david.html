  <title>Change Your Thoughts and You Change Your Life - Valérie David</title>

The author connects with the readers in a voice that is simple and inspiring. She encourages the reader to see that big changes can happen in our lives when we are willing to change the thoughts that we think.  We are encouraged to affirm that anything is possible when we believe. We must release self-defeating thoughts in order to lift our lives up to a higher purpose. Each affirmation should be read with the intention that what you want is already there. When you have a thought, the universe begins to conspire to make that thought a reality. Watch your thoughts, because your thoughts become your destiny. Be amazed by the miracle of your mind. It contains all the answers to your deepest desires." />
