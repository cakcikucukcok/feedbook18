  <title>Journey to Self: Journey to Love - Raechel Rivers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Journey to Self: Journey to Love is a collection of personal poems, thoughts, and blog entries from my journey through love.  In searching for love, I&#39;ve continued to make a full circle back to myself and my Creator.  Some of the stories are sad and some funny, but all are worth sharing.  It is my hope that lives will be touched and changed by seeing the authenticity of my experiences and perceptions.  I&#39;m not afraid of the truth; it is what sets me free
During my short 30 years of life, I&#39;ve experienced so much about love and relationships.  I trust that we all have experienced our fair share.  What if your experiences and being healed from the lessons learned are a part of your assignment from God?  Now who signs up for heartache and pain?  Not one of us.  If these experiences can be used to help a younger generation or to help heal another, I&#39;m ready to share.  What I&#39;ve learned about love is that it is a journey just like life!  Sure it hasn&#39;t all been roses and it hasn&#39;t all been heartache, but it has been a road that has led me back to my first love; God, my Creator.  This is the refreshing part of the journey.  This is the part of the journey where all of Heaven and the Angels rejoice in knowing that we have remembered the One who first loved us.  There is no greater love.  So I say that, love is a journey where you go searching and ultimately find yourself.  You find the God that is within and the God who created you.  You remember what you were born to do!
Thank you for taking the time out to travel this journey with me!" />
