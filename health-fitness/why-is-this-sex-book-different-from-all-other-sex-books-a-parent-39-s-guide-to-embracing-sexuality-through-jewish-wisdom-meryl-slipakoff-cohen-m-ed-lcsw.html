  <title>Why Is This Sex Book Different from All Other Sex Books?: A Parent&#39;s Guide to Embracing Sexuality Through Jewish Wisdom - Meryl Slipakoff Cohen, M.Ed., Lcsw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why is This Sex Book Different from All Other Sex Books? is different because Judaism is different. King Solomon&#39;s Song of Songs is a perfect example of our appreciation for sensuality and the beauty that our bodies can bring. The Hebrew word &quot;yada&quot; means &quot;sex&quot; but also means &quot;to know.&quot; In Judaism, we do not separate the body from the soul, and we encourage the total knowing that comes with sexual relationships. What a religion!   The heritage has beautiful answers to help parents integrate sexual learning and Jewish wisdom to build pride in a tradition that values healthy sexuality. The author takes Judaism&#39;s sex-positive values and applies them to our modern world. The book is written for parents of all ages of children, from infants to high school, to tackle the age-old questions children ask, like: Where do I come from? Why is my body changing? Am I normal? When is it OK to have sex? How do I know when I&#39;m in love? I think I may be gay; what should I do?" />
