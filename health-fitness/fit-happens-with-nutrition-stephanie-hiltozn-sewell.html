  <title>Fit Happens with Nutrition! - Stephanie Hiltozn Sewell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&lt;i&gt;A nutrition and wellness consultant leads parents through a fun and informative four-week journey on how to teach toddlers about making healthy food choices.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With obesity on the rise in America, it is more important now than ever for parents to make wise and healthy decisions for their children. In her guidebook &lt;i&gt;Fit Happens with Nutrition!&lt;/i&gt;, certified nutrition and wellness consultant Stephanie Hilton Sewell guides both seasoned and novice parents through a four-week learning process that teaches how to incorporate good nutritional habits while transitioning toddlers from baby food to table food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the mother of a toddler herself, Sewell knows all too well that habits children are exposed to during their first five years can set the stage for the rest of their lives. Through her extensive research on diet and nutrition for toddlers, Sewell leads parents on a fun, in-formative journey that teaches how to successfully introduce little ones to nutritious foods through colors of the rainbow, various shapes, different textures and assorted tastes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is never too early to build a foundation for a lifetime of healthy choices. In &lt;i&gt;Fit Happens with Nutrition!&lt;/i&gt; Sewell offers valuable lessons for every parent who is truly committed to providing their children with the tools to make healthy eating choices for the rest of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
