  <title>Procrastinating, Stressing, Eating - Dianne Wintle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Procrastinating, Stressing, Eating&lt;/em&gt; is for the thinking person, usually a woman, who is busy, probably cares for others (or has in the past), and probably also has paid employment. The demands on her time, and also on her mental bandwidth, are constant. She recognises her own health is important, that change is necessary (soon), but while it is important, it is not essential right now. So, once again, change is delayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book looks at why we don&amp;rsquo;t take action to lose weight and adopt healthy lifestyle behaviours NOW. It addresses the fundamental question: Why do we procrastinate over this? Probably not a lack of knowledge or motivation, but rather about overload, habit, stress and scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on the disciplines of philosophy, psychology and economics, particularly behavioural economics, to gain understanding of procrastination, this book aims to gather and condense the most relevant information from the literature to support direct strategies for change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many competing demands may lead to willpower being progressively depleted. &lt;em&gt;Procrastinating, Stressing, Eating &lt;/em&gt;is written for the individual, and guides reflection around individual causes of the current situation, and discusses required skills to change the status quo. Also, strategies are suggested for the individual to lead to success in overcoming procrastination around weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, joy is front and centre of any strategy. Guy Exton&amp;rsquo;s cartoons remind us to see the humour, while Catherine Lockley&amp;rsquo;s recipes gently encourage us back to the kitchen &amp;ndash; but this time, for fun.&lt;/p&gt;" />
