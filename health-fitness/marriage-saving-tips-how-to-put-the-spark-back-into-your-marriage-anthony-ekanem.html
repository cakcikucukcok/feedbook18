  <title>Marriage Saving Tips: How to Put the Spark Back Into Your Marriage - Anthony Ekanem</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is no rule book when you get married. It&#39;s pretty much a &quot;learn as you go&quot; endeavor. You just hope you don&#39;t screw it up or cause lasting damage as you go through the learning process.  Yes, relationships and marriage are hard, but divorce is often much harder, and not just for you or your spouse. Divorce affects the lives of the rest of your family as well, especially children, close friends, and family members that may be interested in your relationship as much as you are. That&#39;s why anyone who has experienced a divorce knows the best option is to work out the problems and save the marriage if at all possible.   This report is meant to help you maneuver through some of the pitfalls of a troubled marriage. It&#39;s not meant to replace marriage counseling, only to give you some thought provoking ways to challenge you and your spouse to consider building on what you have together and the feelings that brought you together in the first place, because, to put it simply... ... divorce is ugly." />
