  <title>The Philosophical Blueprint - Simply Phillip Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Philosophical Blueprint, Browns latest book, is an anthology of positive affirmations and short stories that motivate the human spirit to implement change. The book derives its profundity and poignancy from the authors personal experiences. Brown does not disguise the fact that, like most others, his life has been fraught with mistakes. Instead of regretting his choices, he has used them as means of learning and moving forward in life. With this philosophy at the core of this book, it seeks to assist readers with helpful advice on achieving a peaceful and successful life filled with love and bliss. 
The Philosophical Blueprint addresses and answers the question regarding whether it is truly possible to repair mistakes of the past or prevent them from occurring again by reprogramming your brain. Says Brown, Although I cant erase the programming thats raising havoc in your life, I can provide some new programming in the form of timely advice. With stories, illustrative examples, and sensible advice, Brown makes a powerful impact with his new book." />
