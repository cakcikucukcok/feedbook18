  <title>Who, Who Said the Wise Old Owl - Rebecca A. Alspaugh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Book Description 
Who would have guessed that I would become a caregiver for my in-laws? Who would have guessed that it would have been at one of the busiest times of my life when this happened? Who would have guessed that my father would become critically ill three weeks after my father-in-law died.  Who would have guessed that God gave me the needed strength and time to do this? 
When my mother-in-law was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor I felt like the  bottom fell out of my nice smooth comfortable life. Though my mother-in-law had symptoms of something being wrong health-wise for quite some time the final  verdict and definition of what was wrong still hit us hard. 
My mother-in-law looked to me as her closest female relative to help her and be  there for her. I would not have had it any other way. My husband was patient and  good with his mother but there were certain female health issues that needed to be  dealt with and I was the one who needed to be there. My father-in-law was frail and even though he was there for her emotionally I needed to be the one  who was strong and they could turn to. 
My strength did not last long. I lost patience at home, became depressed and most  of the other aspects in my life changed in ways I did not want. I felt grumpy and let down by those around me even though there were things that only I could and  should have done for my mother-in-law. She thought of me as a precious daughter  and I felt compelled to live up to that. By the time my in-laws had passed away and my fathers illness came about I felt  like an old pro at this care giving business. I could be of some help to my brother  and sister as we went through our fathers illness together.  There is something to be said for experience. 
This book is about choices, laughter in the arrow of pain and insight about how we can be the WHO, who becomes the one others need and lean on. The following  reflections are my random thoughts as I continue to go through the journey as a  caregiver." />
