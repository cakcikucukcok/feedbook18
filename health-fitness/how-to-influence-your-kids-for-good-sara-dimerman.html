You work hard at being a positive role model and being “good” in so many ways, but wonder if what you’re doing and saying is making a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;How to Influence Your Kids For Good&lt;/em&gt;, Sara Dimerman shares her practical and effective step-by-step plan that will help you bring your family together, improve communication, and unlock the very best in your children and yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sara Dimerman makes a convincing case that developing character in our children is one of a parent’s most important tasks.
