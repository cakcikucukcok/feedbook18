  <title>Pizzazz! - Bob Pauley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pizzazz! is a graphic nonfiction self-help bio by Bob Pauley. Its a color-filled, adventure-packed motivational book that outlines tips for success from flipping houses to writing hit songs. Bob describes his journey from country bumpkin to becoming a prestigious member of the Albert Einstein Fellowship and computer scientist for the National Science Foundation. From the deepest coalmines of Appalachia to the wild blue yonder as a jet fighter pilot, Bob has led a rich and exciting life, and hes ready to share his expertise and the pizzazz that comes with it.
His career began in the Hatfield-McCoy backwoods as a coalmining engineer, the inspiration for the rocket boys of October Sky with his red Corvette convertible. As an Aviation Cadet in the USAF, Bob learned aerobatics, formation, instrument, and twin-engine jet fighter skills. As an engineer, he became a rocket and jet engine research programmer with giant IBM computers at Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft. Then he went on to oceanfront resort management in Palm Beach and Nashville, where he met business moguls, movie stars, and entertainers. He became a published songwriter!
Bob Pauley once wrote a song for a wrongfully convicted death row inmate that saved the mans life. By 2001, he added a computer science degree to his rsum, won many awards, and soon became a member of the Albert Einstein Fellowship. He moved to Washington, DC, to work for the National Science Foundation promoting STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Math) education. Following NSF, Bob obtained his affiliate brokers license to flip houses while making music in Nashville.
Bob races cars, cruises the oceans, and barnstorms the skies. He has crashed and burned a red Corvette in Tallahassee and a Cherokee 6 just north of Kingston, Jamaica. He spelunks, mountain climbs, and scuba dives, living life on the edge. His friends over the years include Colonel Harland Sanders, singer Elvis Presley, Congressman Allen West, ukulele soloist Tiny Tim, and soul artist James Brown. Bob has compiled his memories and skillsets into one book to share. It is called Pizzazz! 
Pizzazz! offers its readers something specialthe opportunity to join our Millionaires Investment Group. This is an unprecedented opportunity to flip houses in partnership with knowledgeable teams of investors. In blocks of one thousand dollars per share, beginning flips are possible with shared ownerships of several (five to ten perhaps) like-minded investors. This enables would-be investors to begin investing immediately by sharing their ownership in residential properties with others.
With the innovation of group sharing, Bob Pauley promises cash-strapped investors the chance to invest more quickly. And he shares the opportunity to write professional poetry, music, books, and screenplays in their spare time and to share other exciting and daring adventures guaranteed to bring pizzazz into their lives. This explosive tell-all is a must-read for the adventurous and entrepreneurial spirit." />
