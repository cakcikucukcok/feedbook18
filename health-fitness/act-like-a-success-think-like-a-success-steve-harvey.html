  <title>Act Like a Success, Think Like a Success - Steve Harvey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In his phenomenal #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller &lt;em&gt;Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man,&lt;/em&gt; Steve Harvey told women what it takes to succeed in love. Now, he tells everyone how to succeed in life, giving you the keys to fulfill your purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countless books on success tell you what you need to get that you don&amp;#8217;t already possess. In &lt;em&gt;Act Like a Success, Think Like a Success&lt;/em&gt;, Steve Harvey tells you how to achieve your dreams using the gift you already have. Every one of us was born with a gift endowed by our creator&amp;#8212;something you do the best at with very little effort. While it can be like someone else&amp;#8217;s, your gift is yours alone. No one can take it away. You are the only one who can use it&amp;#8212;or waste it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve shows how that gift holds your greatest chance at success, and the fulfillment of your life&amp;#8217;s mission and purpose. He helps you learn to define your gift&amp;#8212;whether it&amp;#8217;s being a problem solver, a people-connector, a whiz with numbers, or having an eye for colors. He makes clear that your job is not your gift; you may use it in your work, but it can also be used in your marriage or relationship, your community, and throughout every aspect of your life. Throughout, he provides a set of principles that will help you direct your gift. &amp;#8220;The scriptures say your gift will make room for you and put you in the presence of great men,&amp;#8221; Steve reminds us. This book is your roadmap to identifying your gift, acknowledging it, perfecting it, connecting it to a vehicle, and riding it to success. Because Success is the gift you already have.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funny yet firm, told in Steve&amp;#8217;s warm and insightful voice, and peppered with anecdotes from his own life, practical advice, and truthful insights, this essential guide can help you transform your life and achieve everything you were born to.&lt;/p&gt;" />
