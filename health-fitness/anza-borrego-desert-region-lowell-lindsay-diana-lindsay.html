  <title>Anza Borrego Desert Region - Lowell Lindsay, Diana Lindsay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For almost 40 years The Anza-Borrego Desert Region has been the most comprehensive guidebook for Anza-Borrego Desert State Park (ABDSP), Ocotillo Wells State Vehicular Recreation Area (OWSVRA), and the surrounding region including federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) desert lands. It is the book given to new ABDSP rangers to introduce them to their assigned patrol areas and is considered “the bible” for anyone thinking about visiting these desert lands. It is the only guidebook needed for desert hikers, campers, 4WD explorers, mountain bikers, equestrians, and the casual visitor. It includes historical and cultural information as well as natural history of the area. It has been vetted by Park and BLM staff to make sure all descriptions are accurate. It is written in cooperation with California State Parks, the Anza-Borrego Foundation, and the US Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management. This easy-to-use guide includes a backpocket map, highway mileages, and comprehensive road and trail logs. The new 6th Edition has been updated and includes new areas that are now completely part of ABDSP, including more acreage in the Laguna Mountains and direct connecting trails to adjacent Cuyamaca Rancho State Park.
