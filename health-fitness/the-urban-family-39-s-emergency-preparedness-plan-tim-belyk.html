      <meta name="description" content="The Urban Family&#39;s Emergency Preparedness Plan is a guide book to help families or individuals who live in the city, prepare a common sense plan to help them survive an unforeseen disaster. It deals with disruptions in the services which supply our basic needs in short, medium or long terms. The book is more than a guide in that it explains the reasons for the preparations. This knowledge allows you to customize your preparations to suit your situation, based on your location, available funds, family size etc. It also serves as an inspiration to start planning immediately as it shows how many things can be done today which will be of immense help, but need little to nothing in the way of time or money to impliment. The book is a reminder of how complex the system is that supplies us with all the necessities of life and how fragile that system has become. It serves as the &quot;nudge&quot; that most of us need to get us thinking about emergency preparations and gives us the information we need to start." />
