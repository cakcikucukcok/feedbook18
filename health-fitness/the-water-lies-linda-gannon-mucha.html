  <title>The Water Lies - Linda Gannon Mucha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Water Lies&lt;/i&gt; shares the true story of the Mucha family of Biloxi, Mississippi before, during, and after the hour when Hurricane Katrina tore their lives apart. Experience this familys love and dedication as they confronted and overcame a lack of trust and the brutal consequences of poor decisions. Broken dreams, broken hearts, and facing death at different times threatened this family in untold ways, until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sixty minutes, Hurricane Katrina changed countless lives forever. This is one familys story that bares the raw emotions experienced by so many of the families of the Mississippi Gulf Coast. While the country and world embraced the tragic story of New Orleans, and justifiably so, the people of the Mississippi Gulf Coast went about trying to rebuild their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This region took the strongest part of Hurricane Katrina. Communities were literally erased. Hundreds of thousands of Mississippians lost their homes, churches, schools, employment their very culture. While no two stories in &lt;i&gt;The Water Lies&lt;/i&gt; are alike, they all represent the horror of losing everything and the tenacity of starting over. Choices can never be made without consequences and those consequences can be valuable learning opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;" />
