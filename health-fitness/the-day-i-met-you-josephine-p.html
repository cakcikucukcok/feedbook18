  <title>The day I met you - Josephine P</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lucy was just nineteen when her mom kicked her out of the house.&lt;br /&gt;
Left alone, Lucille went to live in the immense estate she had inherited from her grandma.&lt;br /&gt;
It has been eight years since then and suddenly her stepsister, Nicole, who she could never stand, calls her, asking her to spend Christmas together and let go of the past.&lt;br /&gt;
Lucy agrees and when she arrives to the Christmas Eve&amp;rsquo;s dinner, she will meet Nicole&amp;rsquo;s future husband, Xavier Blanc.&lt;br /&gt;
She surprisingly finds out of having met him five years before. That common past will immediately create a chemistry between the two, but Nicole has no intention of accepting the intrusion of Lucy in her life.&lt;br /&gt;
Then why did she invite her to the party? Does Nicole really want to start over, or has she reconnected with Lucy for other reasons?&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;emsp;&lt;br /&gt;
ABOUT IT (italian version):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Moving and touching. A story that reads quickly and gives moments of real emotion.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Two wonderful friends and five very sweet dogs that make a great infinite tenderness&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Beautiful!&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
