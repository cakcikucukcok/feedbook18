  <title>Permission to Parent - Robin Berman, MD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After being bombarded by parenting fad after parenting fad, moms and dads finally have a friendly, commonsense guide to raising thriving children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, many parents have rejected the dictatorships they resented from their own childhoods. But they overcorrected by turning into child-pleasers. Showering praise and letting kids rule the roost has actually eroded the very self-esteem parents are trying to create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using her clinical experience, psychiatrist Robin Berman shows parents how they can take charge while building a loving family with deep connections. How children learn love and respect at home becomes the template for how they show love and respect in life. It&amp;#8217;s a huge task, but Dr. Berman is your ally every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every parent&amp;#8217;s struggles are reflected (many of them comically), but so are heartwarming triumphs.&amp;#160; Parents, teachers and children themselves recount turning points at which they figured out what great parenting looked like and the magic it unlocked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This engaging book&amp;#8212;a perfect mix of medical research and inspirational anecdotes&amp;#8212;just might be the key to being the parent you want to be and the parent your children need.&lt;/p&gt;" />
