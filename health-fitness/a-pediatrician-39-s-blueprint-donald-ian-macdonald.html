  <title>A Pediatrician&#39;s Blueprint - Donald Ian Macdonald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;A Pediatrician&#39;s Blueprint&lt;/I&gt; is written by an experienced pediatrician with the help of experts in various fields and using information gained from many sources that are cited. Parents have come to trust their pediatricians and the advice given by them. Rather than addressing the issues of nutrition, education, sex, drugs and drinking and violence as issues to be treated separately, this book sees the prevention of all best served by one common approach to parenting that stresses the setting of goals here enumerated and the development of a mission statement with a strategy for its implementation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rather than approaching the parenting issues that are addressed in the other parenting books as single subjects, Donald Ian Macdonald, M.D., sees them all as part of the whole of parenting that involves knowing about your child, knowing how to be a 21st Century co-parent; knowing how to help your child to eventually separate from you and as a healthy goal oriented adult; and knowing how best to deal with the problems of inappropriate peer pressure, media messages, and time allocation.&lt;/div&gt;" />
