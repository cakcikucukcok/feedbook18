  <title>Dancing in the Kitchen - Colleen Duffy-Someck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt; Dancing in the Kitchen&lt;/i&gt; is filled with advice and encouragement for anyone challenged by their relationship with food. Colleen Duffy-Someck shares her twenty-year struggle with an eating disorder and the path she took to find complete recovery.

Over 40 nutritious recipes that can be tailored to your tastes 
Commonsense advice on good versus bad foods 
Straight talk about the voices in your head that can accompany eating disorders 
Recipes that are customer favorites at JimbosNaturally!, her familys natural foods store 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dancing in the Kitchen&lt;/i&gt; is filled with tips, tricks, and recipes to prepare you for a personal journey to freedom by creating a healthier relationship with food. Colleens simple and inspiring message is this: Dont let anything stop you from feeding yourself well. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; Colleen Duffy-Someck is the Marie Kondo of the food world. There is no judgment about what is right or wrong and no absolutes. In a world filled with mindless checklists, rigid yes and no columns, and another fad diet coming out weekly, it is refreshing to see an author encourage individuals to be resourceful, trust themselves, and ultimately take control. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; No one has ever impacted my perception of eating, like Colleen Duffy-Someck. Being with her in her kitchen, I saw pure joy as she prepared and shared gently made dishes that tasted better than anything I had ever eaten. As I sipped soups or spooned out her mind-blowingly good chocolate pudding, I realized her food was an extension of her beautiful spirit. Without even knowing it, Colleen nourishes the soul and feeds friendships until theyre as tight as her seaweed wraps. She gave me a gift, one that will stay with me for life: foods, in all their natural forms, are life, bursting with rich flavor, a kaleidoscope of color, and bountiful love. &lt;/p&gt;
