  <title>Safe Young Drivers: A Guide for Parents and Teens - Phil Berardelli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sixteen is by far the most dangerous age on the road. A 16-year-old is twelve times as likely as older drivers to die in a crash as a single occupant. Put two young teens in a vehicle, and the odds of death and injury nearly double. Three or four unsupervised teens riding together constitute a recipe for disaster. Despite these sobering facts, the procedure for obtaining a drivers license in most states remains minimal. Some don&amp;#39;t even require a learner&amp;#39;s permit. Some allow the permit to be obtained before age 16. Although some states have installed graduated licensing, with sensible restrictions for the youngest drivers, many still impose only the most minimal requirements. The condition of formal driver education in America is no better. A small number of high schools operate relatively comprehensive programs that require parental involvement. But most have cut back driver ed. classes to the point where they can accommodate only a small portion of students. Even the lucky ones receive only a few hours of behind-the-wheel instruction. Commercial driving schools, even the most competent and conscientious among them, cannot possibly provide complete instruction. Safe Young Drivers helps to address this enormous problem. It is an indispensable guide for teaching teens to drive. Written by Phil Berardelli, a father and former teacher who understands this often frustrating - and potentially dangerous - passage into adulthood, Safe Young Drivers is intended for parents and teens to use together. Each new lesson addresses parental issues, such as how to choose a car for your teen, and provides teens with simple instruction and important tips to remember. With simple graphics, a complete index, and a section called Some ABC&amp;#39;s for the Road - a mini-encyclopedia for teens - Safe Young Drivers offers a valuable tool for all new drivers and their teachers." />
