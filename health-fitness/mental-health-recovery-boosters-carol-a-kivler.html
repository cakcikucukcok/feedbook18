  <title>Mental Health Recovery Boosters - Carol A. Kivler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mental Health Recovery Boosters is a book of inspiration and reflection designed to move readers from mental illness to mental wellness. The 68 short but powerful essays stand alone with messages of encouragement and personal accountability. Based on lessons the author learned during her journey out of mental illness, the essays encourage readers to reflect on daily choices and mental habits that affect their mental wellness. The author discovered during her own journey that what she needed was an attitude shift - a shift from illness to wellness in order to sustain her recovery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;What I have learned over the years is the power of one&amp;#39;s beliefs. We have all heard of the self-fulfilling prophecy - if you think you can or you think you can&amp;#39;t, you prove yourself right on either side. Why? You build your reality upon thoughts you agree are true. Also, you have it within your power to tap into two universal laws: The Laws of Intention and Attraction. Once you set your intention to mental wellness, providence takes over and you attract experiences and opportunities to live the life you created with your intentions. &amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;- Carol A. Kivler, Author&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Readers are encouraged to thumb through the book until they feel the urge to stop and read. Each thought-provoking essay is accompanied by a question that encourages readers to look more deeply into patterns that may be affecting their recovery from mental illness. Space is provided to jot down important insights. Attention to wellness can make a big difference in dealing with a mental illness, and answering the questions helps transfer the commitment of wellness into one&amp;#39;s own life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This powerful book will inspire you to hold yourself accountable for your own mental wellness. When you take the time to reflect on the essays and questions, you will be setting your wellness intentions out into the universe to manifest the life you were meant to live." />
