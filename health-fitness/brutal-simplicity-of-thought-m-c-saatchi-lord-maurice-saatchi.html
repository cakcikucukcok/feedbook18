  <title>Brutal Simplicity of Thought - M&amp;C Saatchi, Lord Maurice Saatchi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The principles of creativity in stunningly simple words and pictures by the man behind the world&#39;s most successful advertising agency&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did two wheels emancipate women? How can a pie save thousands of lives? How can a useless piece of fabric determine social status? How can you make night day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simplicity looks easy. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s easier to complicate than simplify. This book presents deceptively simple examples of concepts that have changed the world--from the single piece of paper that became the American Declaration of Independence, giving birth to the most powerful nation in the history of the world, to the symbol and line that enable us to write music. Thought-provoking and incisive, &lt;i&gt;Brutal Simplicity of Thought&lt;/i&gt; is the distillation, in words and pictures, of the Saatchi method of creativity. This book started life as a training manual for Saatchi advertising employees, and its approach has shaped the Saatchistory for forty years. Its principles permeate the culture, philosophy and structure of one of the world&#39;s best known corporate brands. Whether you are a student, an artist, a manager, self-employed or a CEO, this book has something to teach us all: simplicity rules.&lt;/p&gt;" />
