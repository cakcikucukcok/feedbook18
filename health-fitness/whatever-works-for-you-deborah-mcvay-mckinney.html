  <title>Whatever Works for You - Deborah McVay-McKinney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Whatever Works for You: A Working Womans Guide to Surviving a Busy Life While Maintaining Peace is a semi-autobiographical view into author Deborah McVay-McKinneys busy life. She offers guidance for the working woman who seeks balance while accomplishing everything on her to-do list and maintaining a career, home, and family. Filled with organizational tips and advice-and dotted with humor and history-this entertaining how-to reference manual reveals that living a successful, balanced life is simpler than people realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these busy, stressful times, people want to feel like they have a life beyond work as well as good ideas to help them accomplish this goal. The author cites many different types of women who inspire her thoughts on surviving in todays world. When they are overwhelmed, overcommitted, faced with uncertainties, and just plain stressed-as many of these women are on a daily basis-their strength comes from knowing they are not alone. The common thread in each of their lives is a strong sense of faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning a vacation, managing the holiday season, accomplishing weekly chores, and sorting the paper piles are explained in easy to follow steps, along with checklists and planning pages, to gain an organized, stress-free life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Whatever Works for You, McVay-McKinney encourages readers to find personal time, gain a renewed sense of value, and depend more upon faith to achieve a balanced, peaceful life.&lt;br /&gt;
