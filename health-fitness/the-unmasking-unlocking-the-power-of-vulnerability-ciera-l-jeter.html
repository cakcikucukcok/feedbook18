  <title>The Unmasking: Unlocking the Power of Vulnerability - Ciera L Jeter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="TAKE BACK THE POWER OF BEING VULNERABLE All our lives we&#39;ve been told to be vulnerable is to be weak, so we masked our vulnerabilities to protect ourselves from looking weak or being hurt. However, that is been far more damaging to us. It caused us to become mentally bound, people pleasing individuals. It has caused us to lose or in some cases never gain our own identity.   In this guide, you will discover how to unlock the power of exposure. Although being vulnerable means you are capable of getting hurt, it doesn&#39;t mean you cannot tap in to the power of your vulnerability and live free from the mental captivities we find ourselves in just because we don&#39;t want to seem weak.   Some of the topics include: Getting to know You, Learning to Love You, Getting through the Pruning Process, Overcoming Fear of Rejection Sharing Your Value with Others." />
