Conwell, founder and first president of Temple University, over 6000 times in the 19th century. Wanting to like the book, I trudged through ⅓ of it until I finally remembered that life is too short to keep reading a book you don't enjoy.<br /><b><i>Acres of Diamonds: H. Conwell, Russell: 9781983783500 ...</i></b> | Russell Conwell Middle Magnet School in Philadelphia bears his name as well. The school yearbook is entitled Acres of Diamonds . Temple University's football team wear diamond decals on their helmets and diamond trim on their collars to reference Conwell's "Acre of Diamonds" speech.<br /><b><i>Russell Conwell - Wikipedia</i></b> | Thus begins one of the true classics of Business and Personal Development literature – Russell Conwell’s “ Acres Of Diamonds ” . The story of Ali Hafed is only one of several “parables” in Conwell’s book – each with their own lessons but all of them pointing to the one truth he spent a lifetime sharing: “There are acres of diamonds to be found in your own back yard if you will but dig for them.”<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Acres of Diamonds - Russell Conwell</a> </h3></p><hr/>
