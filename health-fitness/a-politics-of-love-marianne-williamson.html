  <title>A Politics of Love - Marianne Williamson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this stirring call to arms, the activist, spiritual leader, and &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of the classic &lt;em&gt;A Return to Love&lt;/em&gt; confronts the cancerous politics of fear and divisiveness threatening the United States today, urging all spiritually aware Americans to return to&amp;#8212;and act out of&amp;#8212;our deepest value: love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;America&amp;#8217;s story is one of great social achievement. From the Abolitionists who fought to outlaw slavery, to the Suffragettes who championed women&amp;#8217;s right to vote, to the Civil Rights proponents who battled segregation and institutionalized white supremacy, to the proponents of the women&amp;#8217;s movement and gay rights seeking equality for all, citizens for generations have risen up to fulfill the promise of our nation. Over the course of America&amp;#8217;s history, these activists have both embodied and enacted the nation&amp;#8217;s deepest values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, America once again is in turmoil. A spiritual cancer of fear threatens to undo the progress we have achieved. Discord and hatred are dissolving our communal bonds and undermining the spirit of social responsibility&amp;#8212;the duty we feel toward one another. In this powerful spiritual manifesto, Marianne Williamson offers a tonic for this cultural malignancy. She urges us to imitate the heroes of our past and live out our deepest spiritual commitment: where some have sown hatred, let us now sow love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williamson argues that we must do more than respond to external political issues. We must address the deeper, internal causes that have led to this current dysfunction. We need a new, whole-person politics of love that stems not just from the head but from the heart, not just from intellectual understanding but from a genuine affection for one another. By committing to love, we will make a meaningful contribution to the joyful, fierce and disruptive energies that are rising at this critical point in time. In the words of Abraham Lincoln, &quot;we must think anew, and act anew . . . and then we shall save our country.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
