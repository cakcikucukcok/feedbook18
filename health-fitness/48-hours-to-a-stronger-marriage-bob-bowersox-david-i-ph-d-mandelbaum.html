  <title>48 Hours to a Stronger Marriage - Bob Bowersox, David I. Ph.D. Mandelbaum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you really &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; your spouse, you can fall in love with them all over again.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;48 Hours to a Stronger Marriage&lt;/i&gt; is a strong and simple book that can help you close what author Bob Bowersox calls &quot;the intimacy gap.&quot;  When Bob discovered that he and his wife of twelve years, Toni, had drifted apart, he was determined to keep their marriage alive.  The core of the problem?  Though they still loved each other, Bob and his wife no longer knew each other very well.  Most of their ideas about one another had been formed when they first met and married--and had never changed, even as they themselves were growing and changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Bob devised a &quot;reacquaintance form&quot; for husbands and wives to complete, covering subjects like work, intimacy and family life.  Husband and wife filled in answers to topics like &quot;three things I would do if I had the money to do them&quot; and &quot;on a scale of 1 to 10, the importance I think intimacies like hugging, cuddling and lovemaking have in a relationship&quot;.  Sharing the information on the reacquaintance forms along with a two day period of getting to know one another again served as the spark for Bob and Toni to cement their marriage and make a commitment for the future.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow Bob&#39;s easy 48 hour plan and remember why you and your spouse planned to be together forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
