I hope you will see how important that book is to me. I have trouble every day. ButI know He&amp;#39;s in my life and without Him I would not live. I know you have times when you&amp;#39;ve needed help. For a while I couldn&amp;#39;t even pray. I knew better but I had lost hope. I&amp;#39;ve had such help from the Veterans. I have friends now. And I trust those who I know will be O.K. Please read the Biblical stories thoughtfully. They are scriptures passed down from six or seven thousand years ago.&lt;/p&gt;" />
