  <title>Closer to God - Eduardo Villegas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is an interconnection between the spiritual and the natural, between the visible and the invisible. Although our eyes cannot grasp it, every earthly action activates a result in the spiritual, and vice versa. Paul says For we live by faith, not by sight, So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal. The invisible world is more real than the visible but the latter captures most of our attention.
Jesus had His spiritual eyes wide open, and lived simultaneously in both worlds, giving priority to the spiritual. I think this was the key to finish all his work having lived around thirty-three years as a man on earth. So when He taught His disciples to pray, told them to ask Thy kingdom come and Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth so there is a heavenly kingdom to bring. We cannot continue living disconnected from the Creator. Nothing urges us more in the world than learning how to live and operate Closer to God." />
