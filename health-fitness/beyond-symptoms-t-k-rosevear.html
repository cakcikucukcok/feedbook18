  <title>Beyond Symptoms - T. K. Rosevear</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is my hope, that this information can lead you on a path of wellness - we are made of what we eat, think and feel - and, we should eat to increase our strength, preserve our health, and nourish our life. We should think more positively, attentively, and aware of the consequences of negative thoughts contributing to dis-ease, pain, suffering and trauma. And, finally we should learn to FEEL all our emotions - negative and positive - to achieve growth and the potential for an intuitive, connected, and well-deserved future towards the goal of synchronizing our Body, Mind and Spirits.
I have all the faith, in the world, that with this knowledge or body of evidence, the reader can completely and convincingly come to the conclusion, beyond a reasonable doubt - that it is our responsibility to feed, clothe and shelter ourselves against F.E.A.R. and societys beliefs regarding how we should or should not do this.
It is &quot;my&quot; truth within these pages, based on my personal and professional experience - it is up to you, whether you digest it (totally or partially), assimilate the information to your personal beliefs, thoughts and ideals, and/or eliminate the information from your data base altogether.
The choice is always yours...
and always will be...
Forever !
