  <title>Sectioned Branch Complex - Kate Okundaye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book, Sectioned Branch Complex, is a counselor. It speaks to all and sundry concerning a special lifes issue. Read it, read and read again. I found it new and revealing each time I read it. Great work! 
Cecy 
When I told you my story some years ago, I never knew it would be made into a book of this kind. 
This book is written in a simple, straightforward language and should be easily read by all. 
The content borders on a decision taken every day by someone somewhere all over the world in different locations and, as a result, affects in different proportions the totality of man, woman, boy, or girl in the family and later societies. 
This book is a must-read for counselors, pastors, lay people, and everyone who desires to bequeath a legacy of a mentally stable society to the next generation.
