  <title>Character Wars: America&#39;s Failing Character - Joe Dixon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="America is having a nervous breakdown. Its national character has fragmented. Americans no longer stand united, and they never will again. They are at each other&#39;s throats. What happened? What went wrong? This is the strange tale of how America is being destroyed by its conflicting character types. Even worse, this is a problem that cannot be resolved. There is no &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; set of policies that can accommodate character types that seek radically different things. This makes consensual government impossible. Oswald Spengler, in his apocalyptic masterpiece &quot;The Decline of the West&quot;, wrote, &quot;2000-2200: Formation of Caesarism. Victory of force politics over money. Increasing primitiveness of political forms. Inward decline of the nations into a formless population, and Constitution thereof as an imperium of gradually increasing crudity of despotism.&quot; America, with the advent of Donald Trump, has entered its Caesarian period. Things will never be the same again." />

There is no "one-size-fits-all" set of policies that can accommodate character types that seek radically different things. This makes consensual government impossible.
