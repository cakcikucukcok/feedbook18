style=&#39;font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%&#39;&gt;is a hard-hitting focus on inner city
survival from a kids perspective. Using his life in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;st1:State&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;&lt;span

style=&#39;font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%&#39;&gt;, Joseph Alicea provides readers with
true-life examples that speak to the successes and failures of teenagers. Joes
stories communicate directly with young readers. His secondary intent is to
share these experiences with parents, hoping that they use them as a means for
discussing critical growing up issues with their children. Joe links his
message through the paths he took as an example of how every step you take will
define your &lt;u&gt;Character, Future, and Legacy&lt;/u&gt;. Portions of the text may seem
too direct. However, Joes intent is not to preach. He firmly believes that
young readers need to &lt;i style=&#39;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&#39;&gt;hear&lt;/i&gt; the words as
he intended them  passionate, honest, to the point, and with a sense of caring
for them. He wants young readers to recognize the fact that many kids go
through tough and confusing times just as they may be having; yet those kids
survive. He also hopes that his frank discussions will encourage parents to be
as forthright with their children about their own experiences as he has been in
his book.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
