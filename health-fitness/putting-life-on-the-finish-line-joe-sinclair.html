  <title>Putting Life on the Finish Line - Joe Sinclair</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A guide for those interested in staying physically active, and written by a long distance endurance athlete with a passion for running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When author Joe Sinclair turned sixty-two years old, he began his quest to run as many marathons as possible. Less than five years later, he has logged more than four thousand miles, participating in more than 150 marathons. In his memoir, Putting Life on the Finish Line, he tells his life story from his early years through his late sixties and details how he achieved his running goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinclair shares runnings rewards and challengescrossing the finish line at the toughest marathon in America run entirely on asphalt; completing three marathons in three days in the hot July weather; fighting off attacks by vicious dogs during a lonely, rural, mountain marathon; and helping a struggling young marathoner achieve his very first marathon finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offering personal secrets for success, tips and tricks, nutritional and fitness plans, pre-race plans, and inspiring stories, &lt;i&gt;Putting Life on the Finish Line&lt;/i&gt; provides encouragement for those who believe they are too old to accomplish a dream. It shows that personal health and fitness is attainable at any age.&lt;/p&gt;" />
