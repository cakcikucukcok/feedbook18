  <title>I Now Pronounce You... - Krazy Kaur</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We&#39;re coming up on the 25th anniversary of the surprise hit film, Thelma and Louise, which seemed to strike a cord with the American public, in particular American women. Like Thelma and Louise, many women in our society start off on the road trip of their adult lives with every intention to keep their place and follow the rules. The trouble is that too often men don&#39;t play by the same rules-and if they cheat, women lose. As a consequence, like Thelma, who for years put up with an overbearing husband, women often suffer as second-class citizens, if not with respect to competing with men in our society, many times in their relationships where power is not distributed evenly. I Now Pronounce You... was written to give the reader a chance to recognize in the novel&#39;s characters, issues they may be dealing with in their relationships. Once identified, the solutions to complex problems are never straightforward, but a good therapist can be invaluable as an aid to working out those solutions." />
