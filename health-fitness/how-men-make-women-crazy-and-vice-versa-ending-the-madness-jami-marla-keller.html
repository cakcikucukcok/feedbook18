  <title>How Men Make Women Crazy (And Vice Versa): Ending the Madness - Jami, Marla Keller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How do men make women crazy? The same way women make men crazy; through sabotaging intuition. When you know something is wrong in your heart, but choose to believe it is really okay, it makes you crazy. It may not always be intentional; in fact, most often it is done out of fear.&lt;p&gt;
In this book you will find a way out of the crazy-creating, intimacy-shattering, fearful behaviors that paralyze so many relationships today. Jami and Marla offer hope and wisdom in discovering how to move past the craziness and move in to a desire for deeper intimacy and love.&lt;p&gt;
Praise for Jami and Marlas &lt;i&gt;How Men Make
Woman Crazy (and Vice Versa)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Jami and Marla have such heart and compassion for helping others. The concepts they share in this book are universal in their effectiveness and can work not only for married couples but for individuals as well who may want to get a better understanding of the relationships in their lives. We can honestly
say without a doubt that our marriage has not only been salvaged, but we are discovering each other all over again in a new way! &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Deborah and Lincoln&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Thank you so much for your book. Simply amazing, and a blessing! I have come so far because of both of you. I cannot thank you enough for getting me through the hell and helping me find the true Jennifer. Now here I am happier than I ever thought. Wow.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Jennifer&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;We were one signature away from divorce for an entire year, but reading this book and following its concepts saved our marriage and has brought us to a new intimacy we never thought possible.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
