  <title>The Search - Alannah Dore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Motivated by the need for her children to have a healthy, stable, parent, author Alannah Dore broke through the despair of post-natal depression and the collapse of her immune system to find healing and ongoing empowerment through self-parenting on all levels. Now she recounts her journey in &lt;i&gt;The Search&lt;/i&gt;, sharing the three habits that led her from symptoms of physical, emotional, and mental pain to holistic happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To succeed, it was critical for her to determine exactly what choices she needed to make in her own life. Her first momentous, life-changing choice was made when she was collapsed on her living room floor. She had just received the devastating news from her doctors that she would never get better. Even so, she was determined to find a way to improve her physical and emotional health, a decision that lead her to develop a personalized, nurturing and healing collection of strategies, that became a self-parenting system. Alannah explains that in order to achieve Holistic Happiness or true overall happiness, we must learn to care for ourselves emotionally and physically, in the same way we would effectively care for a child. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Search&lt;/i&gt; shares her foundation techniques for self-parenting, demonstrating how we can create miracles for health, better relationships, better parenting, and healing in order to triumph with humour and gentleness. &lt;/p&gt;" />
