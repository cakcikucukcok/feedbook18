  <title>Joy and Sorrow…You Lead the Way - Dean Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Joy and Sorrow ...You Lead the Way The stories are about the journey the author takes as she remembers and shares with the reader her experiences from the tender age of three through to adulthood. Woven through in precise detail are the lives and deaths of close family members. Each member carries her along in depth as she travels through her own road of life. The stories describe how every event influences and impacts her life to the extent of profoundly shaping who she eventually becomes.&lt;br&gt; The writer observes from three years of age to adulthood how various family members live and eventually meet their deaths. The saga first began with her standing and watching in the doorway as she sees her mother rocking her sixth month old baby brother in her arms while he labors to take each breath. His little arm goes limp and falls to his side as he takes his last breath. She witnesses the tears streaming down her mothers face. Thus the stories slowly but surely unfold carrying the reader grippingly right into the life of the author as she shares her Joys and Sorrow ...as she leads the way.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Death is a season we all must pass through. And just like flowers, God awakens us to ... So why should we grieve when our love ones die For well meet them again in a cloudless sky. By Big mike" />
