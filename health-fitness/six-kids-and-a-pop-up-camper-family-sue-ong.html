  <title>Six Kids and a Pop-Up Camper - family, Sue Ong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;8 people - 6 Months - 1 Country -  43 States - 20 Cities - 18 churches visited - 10 homes  - 24 campsites - 5 host churches  - 2 Bible Conferences - 20 National Parks - 20 Museums - 7 Capitol Buildings - 2 Military Bases - 2 Space Shuttles - 3 Great Bridges - 108 Fridge Magnets - 21, 139 Kilometers (or 13, 138 miles)&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Singaporeans, Dan and Sue, decided to take their six homeschooled children on an epic 6-month road trip in the USA, they never did imagine just how tremendous their experience would turn out to be! Traveling with their faithful Pop-up Camper, 6 kids in tow (15- 3 years old), America has left them with a deeply enriching experience. A full colour, 300 page book with many stunning and inspiring photographs taken by their eldest son Asher (who was 15 at the time of the trip), this travelogue attempts to chronologically record the family&#39;s epic 43 state journey around the USA. The whole family contributes many candid thoughts and learning moments being on a daily shifting schedule and of their encounters in a vast country so different from their own. 
As exciting as any unscripted adventure could go- expect the unexpected. There were many ups and downs in the course of their journey. The Ongs give an insight into some of their Christian guiding principles on how their family of eight co-exist together in loving relationships, and how they overcame obstacles and difficulties they encountered. School was everywhere they camped, Education was lived out, America was their textbook, and God, their Master Teacher!&lt;p&gt;" />
