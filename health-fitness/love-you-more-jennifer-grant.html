  <title>Love You More - Jennifer Grant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;A Stirring Memoir on Parenthood and the Invisible Threads that Bind Us to Those We Are Meant to Love&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;The obstacles, surprises, and moments of grace that Jennifer Grant experienced, working through the adoption process to bring home her daughter from Guatemala, forever changed her life.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Love You More&lt;/I&gt; tells Grant’s deeply personal story of adopting her daughter, Mia. The process confronted her notions about what family means, pushed her into uncomfortable places, and—despite the waiting, adjustments, and challenges of a blended family—brought abiding joy.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Written for all parents but especially those interested in adoption, &lt;I&gt;Love You More&lt;/I&gt; includes discussion questions, tips for prospective adoptive parents, and suggestions for readers on how to reach out in love and support for the world’s most vulnerable people, including orphans.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;“From page one of her courageously vulnerable, intoxicatingly funny memoir about faith and family, Jennifer Grant finds the God of grace in each pot of macaroni and cheese, sticky little hand, doctor’s visit, late-night lawn mowing, and unlikely friend-turned-family-member that decorate her life.”—Cathleen Falsani, author, &lt;I&gt;Sin Boldly&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;“So much written about adoption seems to overlook this essential truth: adoption is about love. Jennifer Grant’s story demonstrates this in every sentence and paragraph and on every page. She tells a story that is smart, funny, and brutally honest.”—Jessica O’Dwyer, author, &lt;I&gt;Mamalita&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
