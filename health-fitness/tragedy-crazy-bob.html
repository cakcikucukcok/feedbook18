  <title>Tragedy - Crazy Bob</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This biography is dedicated to my children whom I love so much and hurt so badly. After my children were born my life was built around these two kids in every way.  The joy that they brought to my life was and remains overwhelming.    I sit back and wonder how I could have been capable of what I did and my heart aches for them every time I think about it.  
The book covers over sixty years of my life. There were many traumatic and tragic events throughout my life but I was able to get over the hurdles and move on to the next phase of my life, even though in most cases it was an extremely emotional transition and still remain with me. In particular one tragic event continues to haunt me and is the main theme of this book. I am sure that others have grown under similar circumstances and have gone through many of the situations that I have.
This book is written in the hope that it may encourage others to move on no matter what the situation might be.  The Lord has your life chartered from the beginning and it is up to you to continue on in his name. Dont give up. There is a light at the end of the tunnel.
Also, you can enjoy the wild and crazy antics that seem to have followed me through the years and Im lucky that I am still alive. Everything thing that is written is the truth, sometimes probably hard to believe and sometimes hard to comprehend but it is the absolute truth." />
