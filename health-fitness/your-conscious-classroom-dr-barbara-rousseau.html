  <title>Your Conscious Classroom - Dr. Barbara Rousseau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The next day, I stood at the open classroom door to greet each and every student  I looked for the small speck of light in each students eyes and recognized it as unlimited potential. From that day onward, love was the guiding north star upon which my classrooms navigated. Within a week  the evidence was there: love first worked! The synergy of a Conscious Classroom was unfolding . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Your Conscious Classroom&lt;/i&gt; presents the power of teacher consciousness. The author recounts experiences in multicultural classrooms: the challenges, the heartbreaks, and the epiphanies. The author includes her research study, Teacher Transformation, in which teachers shared their classroom experiences and profound personal transformations. Malaysian guest author, Dr. Suma Parahakaran, adds insights into the ancient, spiritually integrated Gurukul schools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Your Conscious Classroom&lt;/i&gt; presents transcendent ways of knowing ourselves. What deeper levels of interpersonal connection are awakened through spiritual awareness? As we experience peaceful unity, this boundless capacity stretches our capabilities into infinity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
