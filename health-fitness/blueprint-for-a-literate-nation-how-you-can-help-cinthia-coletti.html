  <title>Blueprint for a Literate Nation How You Can Help - Cinthia Coletti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As the inheritors of both the technological innovations of the information age and the social and economic unrest of the world, the generation now in our schools will, to a great extent, determine whether America stays at the top or falls behind in the world order.
It is imperative therefore that our students master the skills essential to our timesbut statistics show that a huge majority of American children struggle with the skill most essential to modern life. Our society is fueled by literacy, and if we do not stand up for these struggling learners now, the consequences for both the individuals and society as a whole will be disastrous.
Although literacy rates are a nationwide issue, the solution lies surprisingly close to home: Grassroots teams across the country have already begun the movement to reform education, and their successes have been monumental. All that remains is for the message to spread, the spark to ignite. You can be the next leader of change, voicing a clear and compelling call to action. This book will show you how.
Just as learning difficulties are not the fault of the student, ineffective instruction is rarely the fault of the teacher, or even of the school district. The grassroots teams that have brought such comprehensive reforms to their districts have done so by harnessing all the tools available to them in the high-speed, interconnected modern world: in-depth scientific research, far-reaching social media, and direct alliances with influential political champions. The Common Core State Standards already implemented in many states are proof of their success. With a firm commitment to opening opportunities for the next generation, and with the right information to guide you along your journey, you too can make a difference in Americas future." />
