  <title>Romance Scam Survivor - Jan Marshall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How could you give money to someone you&amp;rsquo;ve never met?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the first question most people ask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Jan Marshall, life was good. She had worked hard, set herself up well, and was looking for a companion to share her future with. Just as countless thousands around the world do, every day, she turned to online dating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In just a few months, Jan believed she was &amp;lsquo;in love&amp;rsquo;. She accepted a proposal of marriage, and then sent money - ALL her money - to a professional scammer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did it happen? How can an intelligent person be so thoroughly scammed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan courageously shares the details of her devastating experience, in order to help others recognise such devious swindlers who prey on trusting souls, and maybe even to catch this thief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might think it can&amp;rsquo;t happen to you, or someone you love, but can you be sure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work is a &lt;strong&gt;non-fiction account and memoir&lt;/strong&gt; covering the communication between myself and the scammer, based on my records of our communications. By sharing the personal and intimate nature of the interactions it asks the reader to put themselves in my shoes, and in response the question &amp;ldquo;how could you be so stupid?&amp;rdquo; is answered.&amp;nbsp; It details the process of dealing emotionally with the scam and the financial difficulties that I found myself in afterwards. It is a story of my process through being a victim to becoming a survivor. Areas that need change are also addressed. Some support resources and links are also provided, though this is not the main purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Jan Marshall is a vital voice in the discourse on romance fraud.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Dr Cassandra Cross, &lt;em&gt;Cyber Frauds, Scams and their Victims&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
