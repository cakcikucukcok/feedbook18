  <title>Gut Check - F. David Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a compilation of my experiences of different diet techniques and plans that were both ill-advised and recommended. Through trial and error, I believe I have found a plan that has been very effective with weight loss. Also, through the helpful advice and education of a dietitian, I have been able to lose weight and maintain it on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By publishing this book, I hope to help at least one other person lose weight and keep it off for the long term. Lastly, if there are significant proceeds, I hope to give it to my mother for a better quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for investing in a dietitian lead weight management plan that has worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;" />
