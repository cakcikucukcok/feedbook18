  <title>12 Strategies for Success - Dr. Mabel Joshua-Amadi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Whether you come from a council estate or a country estate, your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude ~ Michelle Obama
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Action is the fundamental key to all success ~ Pablo Picasso
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I have failed over and over and over again in my life, and that is why I succeed
~ Michael Jordan
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
That some achieve great success is proof to all that others can achieve it as well 
~ Abraham Lincoln
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Many people fear success as much as they fear failure. Success is merely the progressive realisation of your predetermined, worthwhile, personal goals. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Whether you are a judge or janitor, student or scholar, entrepreneur or engineer, you can still succeed using these proven 12 Strategies for Success, even if youve never succeeded at anything before.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Without success in any area of your life, living becomes a daily discontent and slow descent into despair.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A change of attitude is a change of destiny for attitude is the criterion for success.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Dr. Mabel Joshua-Amadi draws from a wealth of experience as a medical doctor and academic. She is also the founder and director of Liberty International, a registered charity dedicated to helping the disenfranchised, disadvantaged and distressed improve their attitude and heal from emotional wounds of the past to regain self-reliance and financial freedom and reconnect with family and community as productive members. She is an inspirational speaker, researcher and the author of Power of Attitude amongst other books." />
