  <title>Gifts of Grace - Deb Marcotte</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A mothers worst fears are almost always centered on her children.  &lt;em&gt;Gifts Of Grace&lt;/em&gt; is the compelling and true story of Deb Marcottes worst nightmare becoming an unimaginable reality.  As Deb anxiously awaited the results of the CT scan, she had almost convinced herself that her four-year-old daughter, Allie, was fine. A glance at the medical chart showed otherwise. Debs heart sank as reality was confirmed by the doctor with words that sent her world spiraling  It looks like she has had a stroke. But there are older strokes that are present as well. Guilt, fear, panic and an avalanche of other emotions erupted as Deb began to tearfully attempt some level of control. As she had done so many other times, Deb turned to God. Deb prayed for strength and understanding.  She prayed that her faith would overcome her questions.  This was the beginning of countless medical procedures in hospitals around the country.  Allie would endure multiple brain surgeries and endless tests as medical experts worked to find a cure. Deb remained strong in prayer and even stronger as Allies advocate. &lt;em&gt;Gifts Of Grace&lt;/em&gt; is an unforgettable story of a young girls inspiring strength, a mothers unbreakable faith and indomitable spirit, and a loving Gods everlasting gifts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
