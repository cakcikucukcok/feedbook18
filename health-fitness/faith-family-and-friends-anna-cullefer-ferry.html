  <title>Faith, Family, and Friends - Anna Cullefer Ferry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Faith, Family, and Friends&lt;/i&gt; presents a collection of poetry that reflects the deep emotions in author Anna Cullefer Ferrys heart. She writes of the faith that has helped her through the challenges of her life in a way that may also help others through their own struggles of faith in God. She also shares very personal verses about her family and friends, writing about those closest to her through both the happy and sad times of her life.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;From a poignant poem about her brother, Bobby, who died too young to an uplifting poem about her loving father called My Daddy, these verses invite us into Ferrys life. It is her profound faith in God and the love of her family and friends that shines through in &lt;i&gt;Faith, Family, and Friends.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;Tomorrow 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If tomorrow never comes&lt;br&gt; 
And I sleep the longest night,&lt;br&gt; 
I pray that what they say of me&lt;br&gt; 
Is that she was a guiding light.&lt;br&gt; 
If tomorrow never comes&lt;br&gt; 
And I cannot see the sun,&lt;br&gt; 
I hope it shines on everyone&lt;br&gt; 
To show my work was done.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Anna Ferry is striving to present reflections on questions that trouble and challenge many of us. Are we willing to live by faith, do we find peace in Gods house, and do we sense the presence of the Spirit in my life, my world, and my relationships?&lt;br&gt;
