&lt;p&gt;Youre not satisfied with your current condition and want to change. Does thirty days to a new you sound too good to be true? You could eat nothing but meat or drink only juice for thirty days and lose weight. You could exercise three hours per day for the next thirty days. How long do you think youll keep that up? In thirty days, you can create habits that will make a better you, and in ninety days, you can see a very real difference. The key is making changes by creating habits that are sustainable and enjoyable. Little things add up. Spinning on a stationary bike rather than sitting on the couch five days per week can add up to thirty pounds of weight loss over the course of a year. Building ten pounds of muscle can help you burn twenty-five pounds of fat. Your physical, emotional, and spiritual health will get better or worse on a daily basis, depending on the habits you develop. Learn high-yield, easy-to-do exercises. Try some tasty recipes that will have you looking forward to dinner at home. Dr. Dickens will teach you some fun, sustainable habits to help you live a healthier, happier life.&lt;/p&gt;
