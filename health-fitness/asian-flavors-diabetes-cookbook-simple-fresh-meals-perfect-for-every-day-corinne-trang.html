  <title>Asian Flavors Diabetes Cookbook: Simple, Fresh Meals Perfect for Every Day - Corinne Trang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The &lt;I&gt;Asian Flavors Diabetes Cookbook&lt;/I&gt; is the first book that takes the naturally healthy recipes and meals of Asian cuisine and crafts them specifically for people with diabetes. Authored by Corinne Trang, who was dubbed by &lt;I&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/I&gt; &quot;the Julia Child of Asian cuisine,&quot; this unique collection of recipes will be attractive to anyone with diabetes looking for a fresh approach to diabetes-friendly cooking.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With more than 125 recipes, this compilation of simple comfort foods from all over Asia will include classics such as wontons and fresh spring rolls, and more contemporary recipes like garden tomatoes and mixed greens salad tossed in an Asian-inspired dressing blending soy sauce, sesame oil, and wasabi. The recipes are nutritionally sound, with plenty of fresh vegetables and complex flavors using readily available ingredients, and they rely on healthy cooking techniques such as steaming, stir-frying, braising, and grilling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The book will open with shopping and stocking techniques, including tips on building a basic pantry of Asian ingredients. Then readers will find recipes covering everything from soups and stews to meat and poultry. Each recipe will be broken down with easy step-by-step instructions, as well as menu ideas for serving one, two, four, or more. An added benefit will be a chapter titled &amp;#147;On The Go, Bento!&amp;#8221;  which shows how leftovers and ready-made sides can be quickly assembled into an on-the-go lunch.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Filled with a wide variety of vegetables, whole grains, and protein-based dishes, readers will discover countless new flavors to enjoy with their family. With meails inspired by Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Southeast Asian food cultures, the &lt;I&gt;Asian Flavors Diabetes Cookbook&lt;/I&gt; will become a &amp;#147;go-to&amp;#8221; book for Asian-inspired diabetes-friendly meals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
