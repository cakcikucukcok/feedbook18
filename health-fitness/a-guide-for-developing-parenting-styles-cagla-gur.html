  <title>A Guide for Developing Parenting Styles - Cagla Gur</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Years ago, a mom who has read tens of books about childrens education and parenting over the years complained me that the cases presented in books were most of the time totally irrelevant in her case, and added that she was unable to get the results she expected when she tried to practice what were written in books. When I brought up the topic during my interviews with many moms and dads, I observed that a lot of parents had difficulty in adjusting what was written in the books to suit to their daily lives. It can be quite difficult task to write a separate book for each parent but why wouldnt it be possible for parents to adjust the information presented and examples given to suit to their own lives? This book was prepared to serve this purpose.
Subjects covered in this book includes a wide age range from early childhood to adolescence. This will enable the families to make the most of this work during all stages of their childrens development.
The book first presents a case study to the reader, and then the reader is asked to put themselves in the heroes place and think what could be done, followed by helpful information regarding the resolution of the case and the reader is asked to focus on how s/he could solve this problem in the light of available information. What is aimed here is to make sure the readers can analyze situations with a different perspective, evaluate the subjects in a constructive manner, reach a judgment after re-evaluating in the light of information presented regarding the subject being discussed and devise solutions that would suit to their own family structures in consideration what are given." />
