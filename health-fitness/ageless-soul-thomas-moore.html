  <title>Ageless Soul - Thomas Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ageless Soul &lt;/i&gt;will teach readers how to embrace the  richness of experience and how to take life on, accept invitations to  new vitality, and feel fulfilled as they get older.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thomas Moore is the renowned author of &lt;i&gt;Care of the Soul, &lt;/i&gt;the classic #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller. In&lt;i&gt; Ageless Soul, &lt;/i&gt;Moore reveals a fresh, optimistic, and rewarding path toward aging, one that need not be feared, but rather embraced and cherished. In Moore&#39;s view, aging is the process by which one becomes a more distinctive, complex, fulfilled, loving, and connected person. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Using examples from his practice as a psychotherapist and teacher who lectures widely on the soul of medicine and spirituality, Moore argues for a new vision of aging: as a dramatic series of initiations, rather than a diminishing experience, one that each of us has the tools--experience, maturity, fulfillment--to live out. Subjects include:&lt;br&gt;*Why melancholy is a natural part of aging, and how to accept it, rather than confuse it with depression &lt;br&gt;*The vital role of the elder and mentor in the lives of younger people&lt;br&gt;*The many paths of spiritual growth and learning that open later in life&lt;br&gt;*Sex and sensuality &lt;br&gt;*Building new communities and leaving a legacy&lt;/p&gt;" />
