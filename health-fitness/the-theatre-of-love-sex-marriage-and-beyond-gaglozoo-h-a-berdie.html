  <title>The Theatre of Love, Sex, Marriage and Beyond - Gaglozoo H. A. Berdie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is through a deep reflection that I have been able to frame the title of this book, which is The Theatre of Love, Sex, Marriage and Beyond.
In fact, the contents of this book take their roots from the title.
This book is designed to cover as much as possible, a substantial number of the various aspects of the subjects I have discussed, as dealt with specifically by the innumerable authors at one time or the other. It is without the slightest doubt that not all or every aspect of the subjects of love, sex, and marriagewritten or propounded by authors, researchers, psychologists, sexologists, and medical scientistscan be found in one book.
These different and innumerable ideas, theories, hypothesis, and research findings are as scattered in uncountable books, articles, newsprints, or papers and magazines.
I will, in all honesty, admit that what I have attempted to do in this book is only a tip of the iceberg, considering the infinitude of the intellectual input and output of others in the myriad of data on the subject.
I have divided this book into four parts: love, sex, marriage, and the beyond.
These notwithstanding, I hope this humble rendition, however inadequate, would give readers a general overview of the essentials of these enigmatic subjects of love, sex, marriage, and the beyond." />
