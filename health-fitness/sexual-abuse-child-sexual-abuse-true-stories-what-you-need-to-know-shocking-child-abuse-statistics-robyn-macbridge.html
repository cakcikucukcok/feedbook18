  <title>Sexual Abuse - Child Sexual Abuse True Stories: (What You Need To Know &amp; Shocking Child Abuse Statistics!) - Robyn MacBridge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Sexual Abuse - Child Sexual Abuse True Stories (What You Need to Know &amp; Shocking Child Abuse Statistics!)&quot; is more than just a book of child abuse stories. The victims of child sexual abuse are 1 out of 4 girls and 1 out of 7 boys (World Health Organization). A majority of the offenders are people they know and trust like their family members. Each child has his/her own childhood sexual abuse story and it&#39;s a horror that each one have had to live through. There are 7 brief child abuse stories in this book that allows you to take a peek into their world to see what the child experienced, as well as food for thought about that particular experience. In an effort to increase awareness and keep the frequency of sexual abuse and child molestation to a minimum, this book also includes advice from experts and practical tips - some of which might have never crossed your mind, as well as a look into the plight of survivors." />
