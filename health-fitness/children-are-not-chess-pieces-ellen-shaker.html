  <title>Children Are Not Chess Pieces - Ellen Shaker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I believe most of marry with the assumption this person is our forever partner. Often our ideals of forever are cut short by divorce  While I hope divorce is never a part of your life, it seems we have grown to give marriage little regard. The shortcomings that lie deeply within us often manefest themselves when we are tested by the pressures of divorce. It can be easy to loose sight of what&#39;s most important. When we make  descisions in an attempt to hurt  our spouse, we are in fact asking our children to experience things we should ask of no child. We are often so hurt by the prospect of divorce that we loose ourselves in that hurt. And in fact use our children as pawns in the chess match of divorce. We must all try to remember though no longer each other&#39;s partner, we will always be partners in the lifes of your children. Give them the respect their lives deserve.
I have had the dubiuos distintion to have experienced divorce from any and all points of reference. This perhaps can be a guide for each of you  before you run headlong into the things that can be done to our children during the game of divore and in the name of love." />
