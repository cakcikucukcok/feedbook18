To be able to take such meaningful and deep concepts and truths and translate them into a fable that makes it all understandable is an amazing feat. These three authors have accomplished this wondrous challenge and given us a story of grace, depth and wonder, to live our life by.

This book has playfully and lovingly taken complex ideas of immense value and put them in easy to use lessons that can benefit any grade level. This revolutionary approach appeals to the best nature in all of us, and allows a dialogue between student and teacher that is a model for enlightened thinking and awareness in the classroom.
