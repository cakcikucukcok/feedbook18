  <title>Bread Milk and Love Have Expiration Dates - M. M. Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;All the good men are not yet taken, though it may seem that way from the forty-one lies being told to achieve the ultimate sex from another relationship in &lt;I&gt;Bread, Milk and Love Have Expiration Dates&lt;/I&gt;.  One could easily say that love thrives on flattery, and even without an erection, sex is still on their brains.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;But understand that men think of sex every 53 seconds, while women think of it one to four times a day. So what does a woman need to know? Love does not expire with time, so consider taking the mystery to the next level, so that your partner cannot get enough of you. Do fun things together and put the sizzle back into your marriage or relationship to avoid the enticement of: &lt;I&gt;&#39;Til Temptation Do Us Part&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;God created you in love.  He did not create you to live &lt;I&gt;loveless&lt;/I&gt; and in misery. Life is meant to be shared and to experience love together. You need to search him out, find out what he enjoys and stimulate his needs. Become a child-like nature and spice up your life   live and love the moment   be smart, get out of your comfort zone once in a while; try new directions and go for the life you want.  That could be the key to having your partner around for a lifetime without him sneaking out to get the &lt;I&gt;extra gravy&lt;/I&gt; from someone else.&lt;/p&gt;" />
