  <title>Love Starts Here - Avrum Nadigel, Aliza T. Israel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are you ready for a relationship? How can you meet the right person? How do you know it’s right? Will this last?
Thanks to Internet dating and instant global communication, it’s become easier and easier to meet people. So why is it so hard to find the right person? So hard that you may have, almost, given up. Who needs a long-term committed relationship anyway?
The exercises in this workbook are designed to help you thrive in the relationships you have, or hope to find. Created by a married couple – a family-and-relationship therapist and a clinical psychiatrist – this book will provide you with tools to navigate the highs and lows of emotionally-committed relationships. Whether you fear commitment, or find yourself blinded by your love of falling in love, this workbook will help you begin to make changes, to chart a path toward lasting, committed love.
Commitment is hard. But there is meaning in the struggle: You are capable of building a relationship that is far better than the ones you&#39;ve seen." />
