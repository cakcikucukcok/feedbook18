  <title>Grandparents and Grandchildren - Noorjahan Ghazi, Afra Ghazi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is all about understanding humanity in order to improve quality of life. It focuses on family life and the social structure, which needs reforming and reviving in the cool light of humanity. The basis for this book is my article, I wrote about weak relationship between parents and children, and poor upbringing leads to violence, which was published in the Ottawa Citizen in 2004. 
This book is for everyone, especially for the teenagers of our world. If parents cannot become the role models for their children, they should welcome grandparents; they should let them stay close to the children and be the role models for them  And let grandparents become the torchbearers of humanity  our torches started becoming dim when we started losing their guidance.
We need to change our self-serving mindset  Reviving the role of grandparents is a need in our time  Understanding humanity should begin at home; this mindset can understand the significance of taking care of neighbours. As grandparents teach human values, they connect their families with the past, which gives them a better understanding of proper human behaviour. Grandparents teach dos and donts through examples, and they become examples; it is like a game of show-and-tell. 
Although this is not a lengthy book, this text is enough to learn how to respect others and to live with dignity, and to awaken humanity in human relations. Moral and ethical values that build a strong character are presented in the book, and, though these teachings are not new, they have been reminded to mankind throughout history." />
