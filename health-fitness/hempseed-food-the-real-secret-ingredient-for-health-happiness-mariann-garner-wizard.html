  <title>Hempseed Food, the Real Secret Ingredient for Health &amp; Happiness - Mariann Garner-Wizard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hempseed Food, the Real Secret Ingredient for Health &amp; Happiness, includes up-to-date info on hempseed&#39;s nutritional benefits, a history of Nature&#39;s perfect food, and an analysis of the misguided &quot;drug war&quot; that has for too long kept hempseed foods marginal and little-known. Recipes start with basic preparation of whole raw hempseeds and proceed through simple recipes for hungry people to more ambitious dishes for the creative chef. All are selected to show what the hempseed can do and how best to use it, so cooks can include it in their own family favorites as well as the recipes here. Mariann Garner-Wizard has been a cannabis activist and a advocate of good nutrition since the 1970s. She writes regularly for the publications of the American Botanical Council, the primary US organization promoting scientific study of traditional and alternative medicine. She operates CannabisResource, an independent internet site offering hemp- and marijuana-related news, history, and activist resources." />
