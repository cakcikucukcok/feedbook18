  <title>Cash Flow Diary: 10 Steps to Creating Wealth in Any Economy! - J. Massey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="J. Massey wasn&#39;t always a highly skilled investor, but through action steps that he shares in this book, he amassed an impressive portfolio of hundreds of properties in just six years using an intensive approach to learning and then putting to use what he learned immediately and at the Speed of Instruction™. Starting from less than zero, he used other people&#39;s cash and credit to invest in properties, from single-family homes to multi-family dwellings and large apartment complexes to commercial properties. He now owns businesses and teaches others to do exactly what he does today with nothing held back. This insider&#39;s look into the world of real estate investing and building a successful business gives readers the absolute road map to their own success as entrepreneurs and investors. Author J. Massey is not an extraordinary human being; he did not have a formal education beyond high school; he entered the real estate market at one of the worst times in history for that industry; his wife was critically ill and he was injured so he could not work. What makes J. Massey different and very successful as a businessman and real estate investor is that he took action and then kept taking action steps - learning and earning, learning and earning - to get him where he is today. He invites readers to join him; his hope is that he can motivate people to make changes in their lives that benefit them, their families and on for generations to come. It is his mission to provide clean, safe, affordable housing. This book is one way to spread his mission and teach others to do the same." />
