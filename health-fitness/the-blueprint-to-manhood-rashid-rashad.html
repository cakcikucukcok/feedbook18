  <title>The Blueprint to Manhood - Rashid Rashad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The need for this type of book is quite prevalent. It does not take a social scientist to see the impact of the increasing number of children growing up in households where the father is not present. Without the socializing benefits of a responsible mature male influence, whose authority is rooted in love and fatherhood for his family? We as a nation are headed toward some serious social issues that will impact our way of life negatively in the United States of America for generations if we continue sweeping the revolving issue of fatherless males under the rug. Far too many young boys are growing up without the slightest understanding of what a dads presence means in a home plus the daily interaction with a loving father, just to talk men talk. The fatherless male does not realize the brainless and clueless behavior patterns that they have been betraying or depth of his situation until they get older and really see how much they truly miss out on by having a positive, male role model father figure in earlier stages of their everyday life." />
