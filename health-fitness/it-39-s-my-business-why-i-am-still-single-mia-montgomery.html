&lt;center&gt;What Readers Think About This Book&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;I was so compelled by your honesty and realness.  The poetry was beautiful.  Wow, what a gift!!! I also think that the questions were a very wise choice.  Thank you for being brave enough to share your life through this book. Know that you have impacted me in a great way. You have confirmed and reiterated my position about relationships. This book was right on time. I will be re-reading it.  I now understand the importance of knowing, loving, and understanding me!!!!&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
--&lt;i&gt;D.Johnson, Florida&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;This book wasnt about feeling pity over singleness.  It is a book that makes a woman look inside and assess who she really is.&quot;     
&lt;br&gt;     
--&lt;i&gt;M. Edwards, Florida&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;I am a married woman and still this book made me re-look the way that I sometimes treat my husband and the things that I have expected from him.   The poetry alone brings insight and triumph to your spirit!&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
--&lt;i&gt;J. Murrell, Florida&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Though I have read many books, I really enjoyed reading this book by  Mia Montgomery. 
I felt that the author really paid attention to some of the main reasons and the points as to why many  women who are single.  She dealt with issues that need to be corrected and addressed (reversing what mama told you) and how to function within a relationship without losing yourself.  The author used evidence of her life and the lives of her friends in order to make her points clear. Her evidence was convincing because I felt as if I were walking in her shoes, but mostly I felt as if, the pages were answering questions to topics I wanted answers to but didn&#39;t know how or who to ask.&quot;  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;There are many books in bookstores that talk about being single, but I&#39;ve yet to read a book where the author totally puts themself, their  experiences, and their reputation on the pages, in hopes that you will learn from their mistakes and not repeat them.  The information is unique and it offers fresh insight to single women that will help to empower us and build us up.  I think the author was very successful in carrying out the purpose of the book.  This is a book that will uplift and build women, during their season of being single.&quot;
