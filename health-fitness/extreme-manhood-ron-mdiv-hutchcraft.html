  <title>Extreme Manhood - Ron Mdiv Hutchcraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When we see Superman on TV and in the movies, he has it all together. The fact is, we&amp;#39;re raised to be like Superman. We think we&amp;#39;ve got it under control, we can handle it, and we&amp;#39;re in charge. The secret is, there&amp;#39;s a lot of bleeding going on inside. There&amp;#39;s a lot of us that are hurting and there&amp;#39;s a lot of stuff for which we don&amp;#39;t have answers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is it that really makes you a man? Our culture has a lot of ideas. Now, all of a sudden, relationships are more confusing and the expectations of men are more confusing than they&amp;#39;ve ever been.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being a powerful man is not about conquering the world; it&amp;#39;s about conquering you and the monsters inside you. You must conquer six key areas of your life: your mouth, your passions, coldness towards others, hardness, neglect, and selfishness. We all have areas of our lives that need to be conquered. Conquer yours and discover extreme manhood today!" />
