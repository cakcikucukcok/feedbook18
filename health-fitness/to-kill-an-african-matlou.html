  <title>To Kill an African - Matlou</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To kill an afrcian: is a book that seeks to bring to the fore all that which informs the life view and rationalizations of the African both to himself, his racial group and the world.
To give meaning, shape and voice to the silent cry of people of African descent everywhere in Africa and in the diaspora, Africans are everywhere in pain, in chains, in paralysis and in the hold of a generalized and indistinct all pervasive fear. They know they have problems and serious challenges but they do not know how the problems really look like, what is their catalyst and what sustains them and why they are just so hard to overcome.
This book is a very small attempt in the sea of other great and commendable informative literature in the field of African discourse with the express purpose to add its voice to the debate that rages about the African state and how to save the African both from himself and the world at large that seeks to destroy him.
To be an African is a heavy and taxing feat, it takes only a special and rare people of great strength and character to bear the brunt of hate, persecution, propaganda, brain washing and enslavement that the African bears everyday and still emerge with a joyous  and singing heart and a smile on their ashen faces, though the joy is a defense mechanism that attempts to cloud and bury the pain and sense of futility that we feel or the an act to lull ourselves to sleep and ease the hurt, the smile though it be beautiful accentuated by our sublime African features  it is a broken smile keeping in check all the malaise that have come to typify us.
This is a book that seeks to bring the African mental perspectives on life, our socialization mechanisms, our philosophizing about the tragedies that we face and the paralysis that we experience in the face of world events and the march of time, when we consider our African-ness, to our ready knowledge and review.
Africans feel unloved and unlovable, pathetic, weak and helpless, incapable, drained and powerless and that a lot is asked of us by life, by experience and other racial groups, there is a feeling that we are being set for a fall in all that we do and that nothing from us or by us is ever good enough and deserving of acknowledgement.
We are the only group in the world that secretly asks if ever there is an all loving GOD? 
And if there is such a GOD then does he really love even the filthy and sorry looking African? Yes this African who is the laughing stock of the world and who is ashamed of his African-ness even in his sleep, is he also loved?     
The mind of the African is in constant turmoil and serious distress, locked up in a brutal and dirty dungeon that he knows not how to free himself and has seemingly resigned himself to an eternity of imprisonment, but there is hope and the key to his freedom lies there with him in the dungeon of his misery yet unknown to him, Which explains meaning behind this book and its attempt to shine a light in the dungeon and point to the African the key next to him.
It is an attempt to bring the mirror to the African so that he can take a very good look at himself without distortion, pretense or accusation or embarrassment, so that he can see the state he is in, the filth in his life, the shallowness of his actions, the emptiness of his relationships and the sickness that he calls logic etc. to move him to a state of being appalled by his complicity in his downfall, his acceptance of his general enslavement, his submission to stereotypes and stigmas about him and how the propaganda that controls his every thought actually wins him over and is sustained.
This book is about resuscitating the borderline dead.
To correct the wrong thinking that Africans have accepted as right thinking.
To free us from our self sabotaging selves, may you take this journey of self discovery with me." />
