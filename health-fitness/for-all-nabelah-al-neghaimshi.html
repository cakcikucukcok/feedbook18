  <title>For All - Nabelah Al-Neghaimshi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Through life, we live several rolesas mother, father, traveler, job seeker, retiree, etc. Each role has a different scenario, which we play. While we play a role, we forget to enjoy it. We take it more seriously than it should be taken. It is difficult to live with someone who often criticizes and insults others. It is much harder if the critic is you, criticizing yourself. 
Who is more precious than a self constantly sticking with you in all conditions. Isnt it yet the time for accepting and getting along with that self with love and reconciliation? 
Cruelty will not change the past but rather distresses the present and the future. 
In all roles, we deserve to enjoy living and to have a relationship in which each party is a winner and mostly happy. 
Through this book, I have reviewed some of our roles in life. My first goal of this book is to invite you to reflect on your life, identify ways of improving it, and find ways to avoid preventable pains. 
It is a highlighting of roles in our lives that deserve to be celebrated rather than living them with painful bitterness because of our ignorance and lack of awareness. 
I pray to God to let this book be good support for all tired hearts and stressed and overburdened bodies who are grasping for a few words that would make them appreciate themselves and feel the value of their presence." />
