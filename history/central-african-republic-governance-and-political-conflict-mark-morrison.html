The ongoing presidential and legislative elections in the Central African Republic (CAR) look set to produce a new government in early 2016.

Since the coup the transitional government, civil society and international partners have launched diverse initiatives to begin the peacebuilding process at the national and local levels, and they have made some gains. Relatively peaceful elections are testament to this. To prevent a backslide, all stakeholders need to learn from their own and others&#39; efforts and address both the drivers and long-term underlying causes of the crisis.
