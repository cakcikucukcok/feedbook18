  <title>The Book of Revelation - Timothy R. Mungovan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="History is littered with those who have prophesied the end of the world, but there can be only one prophecyand the time has come for us to truly understand it. The book of Revelation, perhaps the most misunderstood scriptural text, contains the key to our hope and salvation when the end of days arrives. With the stunning evidence discovered during his exhaustive twenty-year study of Scripture, which included Greek, Hebrew, and Latin primary texts, author Timothy R. Mungovan presents &lt;i&gt;The Book of Revelation: A Complete and Precise Understanding,&lt;/i&gt; a biblical expos containing everything Christians must know about the second coming of Jesus Christ. 
Mungovans compelling, research-driven commentary details every element and event leading up to and following the battle of Armageddon, including
	proof of the latest possible year for the beginning of the tribulation;
	the true character of the Antichrist;
	the four horsemen accurately identified;
	the seven trumpets events and their true meaning and consequence;
	the history and fallacy of rapture theory;
	Gods purpose for the millennial age;
	the fallen angels and their literal offspring;
	shocking photographic proof of the bottomless pit inside the earth;
	a complete quick reference to the events of tribulation;
	a primary list of key biblical metaphors.
The approaching great tribulation will overtake mankind and dramatically alter world politics, economics, and society as we know them today. Only through faith and understanding can we hope to survive the Antichrist and the armies of Satan and live on into the world that is to come." />
