  <title>Taking the Stand: We Have More to Say - Bernhard Rammerstorfer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nine Holocaust survivors and victims of Nazi tyranny have
&quot;taken the stand&quot; to give their testimony as a legacy for future
generations. They are from five different countries and were
persecuted for reasons of ethnicity, politics/ideology, or religion.
All in all, they were interned in fifty-one camps or institutions.
The catalog of questions, unique in the world, consists of 100
questions from 61 schools and universities in 30 countries on 6
continents, as well as from the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum in Washington, D.C. What is truly innovative about this book
is that all the Holocaust survivors were asked the same questions. As
a result, a point-for-point comparison of their answers is possible.
Those whose voices are heard range from an average housewife
and an unskilled laborer to a fashion designer, from those who have
been relatively silent to active Holocaust teachers and to survivors
who have already been widely featured in the media and whose
life stories have even been the subject of Oscar-winning films.
Two of them have already passed their 100th birthdays." />
