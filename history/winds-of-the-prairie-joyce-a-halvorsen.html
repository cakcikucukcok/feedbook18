  <title>Winds of the Prairie - Joyce A. Halvorsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Winds of the Prairie is Joyce A
Halvorsens second novel. This
stunning book offers a prairies eye view
of early Dakota between the years of
1869 and 1901. As a state for only three
years by 1901, South Dakota speaks with
many voices. The story is seen through
the eyes of Lincoln Kenneth Cassidy
from the age 15 until his age of 57. Yet,
no voice is as clear and as demanding as
that of the prairie herself. She accepts
few novices. Only the stubborn and
brave and those who understand the
prairies ways can survive in these
lands. Born of a Lakota Sioux mother
and white father, Lincoln finds he is
torn between his familys cultures and
traditions. He idolizes the wisdom of
his white grandfather Herman Cassidy,
but is awed and frightened by the power
of his mothers uncles, the Elders from
the Lakota Sioux tribe. He doesnt
know his place and is often confused by
each ones values. Linc meets a young
man by the name of Joseph Hawk, once
a slave in Missouri. They become fast
friends. Though free to leave Lincolns
ranch, the Double-D, Joseph chose
to stay. Joseph often acts as a buffer
and protector between Lincoln and
trouble. A turning point in Lincs life
comes when, as a boy, he is asked by
his grandfather to participate in the
Double-Ds cattle drive. There are
many adventures while on the cattle
drive and he experiences challenges
which nearly break Lincolns heart.
But he survives. Later, as a man and
married with the responsibilities of a
ranch owner, Lincoln desires against
family advise to change the ranch
from that of a cattle farm to include conservation and preservation. The
original state of being of the wild
things of the prairie will have primary
importance. He sees himself as one of
the caretakers of the wild things which
are fast disappearing. When Lincs life
is turned upside down by murder, he
vows to seek retribution. The angels of
mercy and forgiveness call out on one
shoulder and vengeance and hate dance
on the other. Linc has no patience with
being merciful and seeks justice with
a gun. Always beside him is his friend
Joseph. The resolution of this story
is a remarkable twist of fate. Always,
Linc is guided by an inner conviction
that the prairie knows what is best.
Her voice speaks to him even when
he feels lost. Winds of the Prairie
is an heartfelt and moving tale about
resilience and hope of many kinds of
people during the formative years of
the State of Dakota. Ms. Halvorsens
understanding of the human heart and
condition, along with her compelling
prose, engages and crosses the
boundaries of a time period from post
Civil War to a new century that should
not be forgotten." />
