  <title>The Hunter Killers - Dan Hampton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At the height of the Cold War, America&amp;#39;s most elite aviators bravely volunteered for a covert program aimed at eliminating an impossible new threat. Half never returned. All became legends. From &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Dan Hampton comes one of the most extraordinary untold stories of aviation history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vietnam, 1965: On July 24 a USAF F-4 Phantom jet was suddenly blown from the sky by a mysterious and lethal weapon&amp;#8212;a Soviet SA-2 surface-to-air missile (SAM), launched by Russian &amp;#34;advisors&amp;#34; to North Vietnam. Three days later, six F-105 Thunderchiefs were brought down trying to avenge the Phantom. More tragic losses followed, establishing the enemy&amp;#39;s SAMs as the deadliest anti-aircraft threat in history and dramatically turning the tables of Cold War air superiority in favor of Soviet technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stunned and desperately searching for answers, the Pentagon ordered a top secret program called Wild Weasel I to counter the SAM problem&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;. So it came to be that a small group of maverick fighter pilots and Electronic Warfare Officers volunteered to fly behind enemy lines and into the teeth of the threat. To most it seemed a suicide mission&amp;#8212;but they beat the door down to join. Those who survived the 50 percent casualty rate would revolutionize warfare forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;You gotta be sh*#@ing me!&amp;#34; This immortal phrase was uttered by Captain Jack Donovan when the Wild Weasel concept was first explained to him. &amp;#34;You want me to fly in the back of a little tiny fighter aircraft with a crazy fighter pilot who thinks he&amp;#39;s invincible, home in on a SAM site in North Vietnam, and shoot it before it shoots me?&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on unprecedented firsthand interviews with Wild Weasel veterans and previously unseen personal papers and declassified documents from both sides of the conflict, as well as Dan Hampton&amp;#39;s own experience as a highly decorated F-16 Wild Weasel pilot, &lt;em&gt;The Hunter Killers&lt;/em&gt; is a gripping, cockpit-level chronicle of the first-generation Weasels, the remarkable band of aviators who faced head-on the advanced Soviet missile technology that was decimating fellow American pilots over the skies of Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;" />
