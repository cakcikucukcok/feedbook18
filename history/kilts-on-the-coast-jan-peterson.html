  <title>Kilts on the Coast - Jan Peterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When the Hudson&#39;s Bay Company decided to establish its new Pacific coast headquarters at Fort Victoria on Vancouver Island in 1843, the Island was a pristine paradise—or an isolated wilderness, depending on one&#39;s point of view—that had sustained its First Nations inhabitants for millennia. It was one of the last places to be discovered and settled by Europeans in North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Scots who came to the Island to manage the Company&#39;s business in Fort Victoria, engaging in the fur trade and establishing coal-mining ventures around what is now Nanaimo, where &quot;black diamonds&quot; were found in abundance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From founding father James Douglas and other high-placed Company men to the humble miners from Orkney and Ayrshire who were brought over on harsh voyages around Cape Horn to work Nanaimo&#39;s mines, the Scottish influence on the young Colony of Vancouver Island was indelible. Nanaimo author and historian Jan Peterson focuses on events and people who sparked settlement and growth in BC&#39;s first Crown Colony over six critical years, 1848 to 1854, and delves deep into the roots of the Island&#39;s Scottish presence, tracing the lives of such pioneers as Dr. William Tolmie, Robert Dunsmuir and their descendants.&lt;/p&gt;" />
