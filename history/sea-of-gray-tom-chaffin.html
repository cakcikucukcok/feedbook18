The subterfuge was ended off the shores of Madeira, where the ship was outfitted for war. The newly christened CSS &lt;i&gt;Shenandoah&lt;/i&gt; then commenced the last, most quixotic sea story of the Civil War: the 58,000-mile, around-the-world cruise of the Confederacy&#39;s second most successful commerce raider. Before its voyage was over, thirty-two Union merchant and whaling ships and their cargoes would be destroyed. But it was only after ship and crew embarked on the last leg of their journey that the excursion took its most fearful turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four months after the Civil War was over, the &lt;i&gt;Shenandoah&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s Captain Waddell finally learned he was, and had been, fighting without cause or state. In the eyes of the world, he had gone from being an enemy combatant to being a pirate--a hangable offense. Now fearing capture and mutiny, with supplies quickly dwindling, Waddell elected to camouflage the ship, circumnavigate the globe, and attempt to surrender on English soil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A superb account of how the Confederate raider &lt;i&gt;Shenandoah&lt;/i&gt; brought the American Civil War to the farthest reaches of the world.&quot; -- Nathaniel Philbrick, author of &lt;i&gt;Mayflower&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Sea of Glory&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
