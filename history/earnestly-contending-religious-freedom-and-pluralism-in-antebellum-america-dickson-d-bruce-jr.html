  <title>Earnestly Contending: Religious Freedom and Pluralism in Antebellum America - Dickson D. Bruce, Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Earnestly Contending,&lt;/i&gt; Dickson Bruce examines the     ways in which religious denominations and movements in antebellum America coped with the ideals     of freedom and pluralism that exerted such a strong influence on the larger, national culture.     Despite their enormous normative power, these still-evolving ideals-themselves partly religious     in origin-ran up against deeply entrenched concerns about the integrity of religious faith and     commitment and the role of religion in society. The resulting tensions between these ideals and     desires for religious consensus and coherence would remain unresolved throughout the     period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focusing on that era&#39;s interdenominational competition, Bruce     explores the possibilities for and barriers to realizing ideals of freedom and pluralism in     antebellum America. He examines the nature of religion from the perspectives of anthropology and     cognitive sciences, as well as history, and uses this interdisciplinary approach to organize and     understand specific tendencies in the antebellum period while revealing properties inherent in     religion as a social and cultural phenomenon. He goes on to show how issues from that era have     continued to play a role in American religious thinking, and how they might shed light on the     controversies of our own time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
