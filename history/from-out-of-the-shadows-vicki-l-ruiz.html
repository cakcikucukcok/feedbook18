  <title>From Out of the Shadows - Vicki L. Ruiz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;From Out of the Shadows&lt;/em&gt; was the first full study of Mexican-American women in the twentieth century. Beginning with the first wave of Mexican women crossing the border early in the century, historian Vicki L. Ruiz reveals the struggles they have faced and the communities they have built. In a narrative enhanced by interviews and personal stories, she shows how from labor camps, boxcar settlements, and urban barrios, Mexican women nurtured families, worked for wages, built extended networks, and participated in community associations--efforts that helped Mexican Americans find their own place in America.  She also narrates the tensions that arose between generations, as the parents tried to rein in young daughters eager to adopt American ways. Finally, the book highlights the various forms of political protest initiated by Mexican-American women, including civil rights activity and protests against the war in Vietnam.
For this new edition of &lt;em&gt;From Out of the Shadows&lt;/em&gt;, Ruiz has written an afterword that continues the story of the &lt;em&gt;Mexicana&lt;/em&gt; experience in the United States, as well as outlines new additions to the growing field of Latina history." />
