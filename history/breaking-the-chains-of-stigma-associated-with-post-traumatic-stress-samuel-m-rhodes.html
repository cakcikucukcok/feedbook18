  <title>Breaking the Chains of Stigma Associated with Post Traumatic Stress - Samuel M. Rhodes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When we met, Sam shared his own story with me and explained his growing passion to help other Soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress.  I encouraged him to expand his efforts, and we kept in touch after he retired.  He shared with me the feedback he received from Soldiers and their families after they had heard his presentations, and he gave me a copy of his first book, Changing the Military Culture of Silence.  I could only be impressed as he carried his message across the country. 
 George W. Casey
 General, US Army (Ret)
 Former Army Chief of Staff
With our veterans committing suicide at an epidemic rate of 22 suicides per day, the chains of stigma must be broken. This book is a reflection of Sam Rhodess personal experiences; he wears the proverbial tee-shirt. One doesnt experience life without experiencing life-changing events. Its how one handles those changes that counts. This book addresses ways to handle those changes to effect a positive outcome.
Charles T. Jones
Colonel, KYARNG
Deputy Chief of Staff Personnel
CSM Rhodes carried the hidden wounds of three combat tours inside him when he returned to Fort Benning to serve as the CSM of the Infantry School Training Brigade.  After much soul-searching and anguish, he finally realized and publicly acknowledged that he suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  In doing so, he realized that part of his healing needed to include a concerted effort on his part to give back to the extended family he had come to know so well, his fellow Soldiers and their families, and to confront the issues plaguing him.
