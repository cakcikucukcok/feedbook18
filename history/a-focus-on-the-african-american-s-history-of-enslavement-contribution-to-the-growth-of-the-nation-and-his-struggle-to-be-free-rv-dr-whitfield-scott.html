  <title>A Focus on the African American’S History of Enslavement, Contribution to the Growth of the Nation, and His Struggle to Be Free - Rv. Dr. Whitfield Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What is Freedom? When is limited Freedom adequate for human satisfaction? It cannot be rationed by those that hate the oppressed. The Constitution is the fundamental document upon which every soul that treads the dirt and pavement of the United States and its territorial possessions walk. This document stretches to length and breadth of the territory where its citizens live and praises the Lord. It provides rights that are not retrievable by the common citizen who desires to control those that are less fortunate than the few. The laws of protection defends against any form of slippage or deviance has the full impact of what freedom brings, from the great Document of Freedom, which is the Constitution of the United States and the Amendments thereof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the Nation became the Land of the Free, and since the Reconstruction after the war between the states brought a freedom that has been challenged by those that feel that they are the sole owners or recipients of such freedom, the record has to be set straight. The perpetrators and victims now must enjoy the same degree of freedom. Justice demands equality for all citizens, even if the former slave owners have refused to yield to the laws of the Land that guarantees the rights to all citizens. They have attempted to slice some of the rights from the Constitution in the name of States Rights. Since the time we elected Barak Obama as President, they have attempted to put more pressure on the system in terms of identification at the voting booths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are proposing that in every state the question should be asked, what are the voting requirements? Once we receive the requirements we should mobilize our churches to assist in the follow-thru ensuring that the voting process is effectuated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should ask the federal authorities to provide some oversight in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;" />
