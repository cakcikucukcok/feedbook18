  <title>Dogface Soldiers: The Story of B Company, 15th Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division From Fedala to Salzburg: Audie Murphy and His Brothers in Arms - Daniel R. Champagne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Merriam Press World War 2 History Series. This story begins in Nov 1941 and recounts B Company&#39;s march through French Morocco, Tunisia, Sicily, Italy, and Southern France and company&#39;s advance over the Vosges Mountains, through the Colmar Pocket and across Germany to Austria. Deservedly so, the starring role in this story is played by Audie Murphy. However, the major focus of the book is on the spirit of B Company. This is the story of the B Company foot soldiers-a moving and vivid account told primarily by the characters themselves, through their own eyes and their own experiences. This is the culmination of a three-year study on B Company. The author has thoroughly examined both secondary and primary sources, including interviews with B Company veterans. 37 photos, 1 document, 33 maps." />
