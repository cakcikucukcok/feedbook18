  <title>All the Kremlin&#39;s Men - Mikhail Zygar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;An extraordinary behind-the-scenes portrait of the court of Vladimir Putin, the oligarchs that surround it, and the many moods of modern Russia that reads like a &quot;real &lt;i&gt;House of Cards&lt;/i&gt;&quot;(Lev Lurie).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;All the Kremlin&#39;s Men&lt;/i&gt; is a gripping narrative of an accidental king and a court out of control. Based on an unprecedented series of interviews with Vladimir Putin&#39;s inner circle, this book presents a radically different view of power and politics in Russia. The image of Putin as a strongman is dissolved. In its place is a weary figurehead buffeted--if not controlled--by the men who at once advise and deceive him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The regional governors and bureaucratic leaders are immovable objects, far more powerful in their fiefdoms than the president himself. So are the gatekeepers-those officials who guard the pathways to power-on whom Putin depends as much as they rely on him. The tenuous edifice is filled with all of the intrigue and plotting of a Medici court, as enemies of the state are invented and wars begun to justify personal gains, internal rivalries, or one faction&#39;s biased advantage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A bestseller in Russia, &lt;i&gt;All the Kremlin&#39;s Men&lt;/i&gt; is a shocking revisionist portrait of the Putin era and a dazzling reconstruction of the machinations of courtiers running riot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
