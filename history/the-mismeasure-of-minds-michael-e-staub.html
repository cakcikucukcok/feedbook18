  <title>The Mismeasure of Minds - Michael E. Staub</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The 1954 &lt;i&gt;Brown v. Board of Education&lt;/i&gt; decision required desegregation of America&#39;s schools, but it also set in motion an agonizing multi-decade debate over race, class, and IQ. In this innovative book, Michael E. Staub investigates neuropsychological studies published between &lt;i&gt;Brown&lt;/i&gt; and the controversial 1994 book, &lt;i&gt;The Bell Curve&lt;/i&gt;. In doing so, he illuminates how we came to view race and intelligence today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In tracing how research and experiments around such concepts as learned helplessness, deferred gratification, hyperactivity, and emotional intelligence migrated into popular culture and government policy, Staub reveals longstanding and widespread dissatisfaction&amp;mdash;not least among middle-class whites&amp;mdash;with the metric of IQ. He also documents the devastating consequences&amp;mdash;above all for disadvantaged children of color&amp;mdash;as efforts to undo discrimination and create enriched learning environments were recurrently repudiated and defunded. By connecting psychology, race, and public policy in a single narrative, Staub charts the paradoxes that have emerged and that continue to structure investigations of racism even into the era of contemporary neuroscientific research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
