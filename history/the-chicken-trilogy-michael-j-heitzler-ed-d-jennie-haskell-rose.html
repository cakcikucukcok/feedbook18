  <title>The Chicken Trilogy - Michael J. Heitzler Ed. D., Jennie Haskell Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Three books comprise The Chicken Trilogy. The first volume in this collection is George Chicken, Carolina Man of the Ages; the second book is George Chicken Jr., Son of Carolina; and the third is Little Mistress Chicken, A Veritable Happening of Colonial Carolina. These three books examine the challenges, successes, and failures of the principals in each of the three generations of the George Chicken family as they engaged the dynamically evolving eighteenth-century Carolina frontier. The first book examines Colonel George Chicken, Indian Commissioner, backwoods trader, planter, and a bold political leader during the era of the Goose Creek Men. That fierce cadre of frontiersmen in the Goose Creek community near Charleston dominated South Carolina leadership for fifty years and led the first political revolution in Carolina. The Berkeley County South Carolina Chamber of Commerce published a brief edition of the first book of this trilogy in 2011. That exposed the need to expand that work, as well as unravel the mysteries of the two subsequent generations of Chicken personalities during the formative frontier decades.
The second expos divulges the story of Captain George Chicken Jr., son of Colonel George Chicken, and an Indian trader, militia captain, parish commissioner, and formative personality in his own right. He mightily contributed to improved relations with distant Native American tribes that hardened the British hold on colonial Carolina. That research knitted the sagas of Colonel George Chicken with his son, George Chicken Jr., and begged to tell the tale of Catharine Chicken, heroine of the third generation.
The third book divulges a sorrowful episode in the life of Catharine Chicken, daughter and granddaughter of the principal personalities of the earlier epochs. This final work of the trilogy vividly describes a colonial-era community; tells of the exploits, challenges, and transgressions of colorful townspeople of that place; and grimly recalls the trials and narrow survival of a tortured seven-year-old heroine, Catharine Chicken. The Chicken Trilogy vividly and dramatically illuminates bold personalities from each of three generations of the Chicken family and recounts their trials and tribulations as they persistently engaged the challenges of the evolving Carolina frontier." />
