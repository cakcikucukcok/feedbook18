      <meta name="description" content="Truth is an absolute. It can be ugly and scary or accommodating and soothingly caring. It can start wars and settle peace. No person alive can be defined in anyway without truth being the measuring rod of comparison. Quite often man sways from the truth, because it doesnt side with their wants or views. This book represents the truth of mans origins confirmed by DNA mathematical and scientific facts. Like truth this book brings conclusion to an age-old argument between Clergy and Scientist. A clear explanation of why were all so different when it comes to race, which it effects so many communities of different races living together. A major benefit of this book is that the very beginning of mans history is unveiled in a new light, which will be the talk of many prestigious inner circles of elite social groups and higher arc political policy makers. Majoring student readers of this book will be informed first ahead of their college professors on the new direction of DNAs future of calculating the mutated percentage cells in any genome. Truth! Some people love being first to know secrets. Others being ahead of the game and the readers of this book will have that cutting edge in life." />
