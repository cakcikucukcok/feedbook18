  <title>Treasure in Heaven: The Holy Poor in Early Christianity - Peter R. Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;holy poor&quot; have long maintained an elite status within     Christianity. Differing from the &quot;real&quot; poor, these clergymen, teachers, and ascetics     have historically been viewed by their fellow Christians as persons who should receive material     support in exchange for offering immeasurable immaterial benefits-teaching, preaching, and     prayer. Supporting them-quite as much as supporting the real poor-has been a way to accumulate     eventual treasure in heaven. Yet from the rise of Christian monasticism in Egypt and Syria to     present day, Christians have argued fiercely about whether monks should work to support     themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Treasure in Heaven,&lt;/i&gt; renowned historian     Peter Brown shifts attention from Western to Eastern Christianity, introducing us to this     smoldering debate that took place across the entire Middle East from the Euphrates to the Nile.     Seen against the backdrop of Asia, Christianity might have opted for a Buddhist model by which     holy monks lived by begging alone. Instead, the monks of Egypt upheld an alternative model that     linked the monk to humanity and the monastery to society through acceptance of the common, human     bond of work. This model of Third World Christianity-a Christianity that we all too easily     associate with the West-eventually became the basis for the monasticism of western Europe, as     well as for modern Western attitudes to charity and labor. In &lt;i&gt;Treasure in     Heaven,&lt;/i&gt; Brown shows how and why we are still living-at times uncomfortably-with that     choice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
