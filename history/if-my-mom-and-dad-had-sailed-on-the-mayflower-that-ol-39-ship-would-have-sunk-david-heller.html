  <title>If My Mom and Dad Had Sailed on the Mayflower, That Ol&#39; Ship Would Have Sunk! - David Heller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="IF MY MOM AND DAD HAD BEEN ON THE MAYFLOWER, THAT OL SHIP
WOULD HAVE SUNK! is a compilation of childrens always hilarious and often thought-provoking views of American history, from our exploratory origins all the way to present-day America.   Based on extensive interviews with children from 7-14, this books cover all the major themes and controversies that surround our very colorful, sometimes glorious and sometimes painful national story.  While the youngsters are often impressive in their knowledge of American history, their apocryphal tales and embellishments produce laugh-a-minute entertainment as well. And sometimes, their views or our values and beliefs, of our social challenges and our wars, and of our progress as a nation are downright poignant and moving -- lessons for all of us at any age or position in life.
	Here are a few of the many wonderful commentaries by the children:
WHAT DID COLUMBUS THINK TO HIMSELF WHEN HE FIRST SET EYES ON THE AMERICAS?   Las Vegas, here I come!  (Jared, age 12)
WHAT DID THE PILGRIMS DO TO PASS THE TIME ON THE MAYFLOWER?
Played chess, but both sides agreed to not use their kings since they hated kings so much.  (J.D., age 14)
IF YOU HAD BEEN A REVOLUTIONARY ERA CHILD, WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
DONE TO HELP THE CAUSE?   Because Im little, I would have hid and bitten the British soldiers on the leg when they were marching by.  (Kwan, age 9)
HOW WOULD TRAITOR BENEDICT ARNOLD HAVE BEEN TREATED IF HE HAD LIVED IN MODERN TIMES?   There would have been a lot of newspaper and magazine articles about what a bad childhood he had.  (Craig F., age 11)
HOW WOULD THE UNITED STATES BE DIFFERENT TODAY IF THE FOUNDING FATHERS HAD BEEN FOUNDING MOTHERS?  There would be laws in the Constitution saying everybody had to brush their teeth more. (George H., age 7)" />
