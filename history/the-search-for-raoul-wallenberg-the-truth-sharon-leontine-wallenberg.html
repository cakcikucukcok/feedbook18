  <title>The Search for Raoul Wallenberg the Truth - Sharon Leontine Wallenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Search for Raoul Wallenberg: The Truth tells a true story that reaches back over one hundred years, touches on the lives of over one hundred thousand people, involves the governments of four countries, includes hundreds of documents, and both exposes scandals and showcases heroism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are many books about Raoul Wallenberg, the diplomat who saved one hundred thousand innocent lives during World War II. This one is unique. It is about all the behind-the-scenes activity involved in the release of the his prison records from the Soviet Union, where the idea originated, why it was important, how it was done, and the background of the impartial investigation that followed. In addition, it exposes the people who tried to prevent the truth, the reasons why, who confronted them, and those who worked tirelessly on behalf of this great hero. I know because this is my story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This story had its humble beginnings in Glen Cove and Sea Cliff, Long Island. The book will demonstrate what an individual can accomplish if they are dedicated, imaginative, courageous, and compassionate. Further, the book extends into the future by advocating implementation of lessons learned, avarice avoided, and compassionate lifestyles adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Proceeds from the sale of this book continue Raoul Wallenberg &#39;s legacy of compassion through Raoul Wallenberg Vegan International (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.VeganInternational.org&quot;&gt;www.VeganInternational.org&lt;/a&gt;) and Raoul Wallenberg Vegan Retreat (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.veganretreat.org&quot;&gt;www.veganretreat.org&lt;/a&gt;).
