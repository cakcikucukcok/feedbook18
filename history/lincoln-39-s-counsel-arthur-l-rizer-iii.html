  <title>Lincoln&#39;s Counsel - Arthur L. Rizer Iii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before Abraham Lincoln was called &amp;quot;Mr. President,&amp;quot; he was called &amp;quot;counselor&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;esquire.&amp;quot; Some consider him to be one of the nation&amp;#39;s greatest attorneys and, at the very least, an enormously persuasive speaker. He spent more years practicing law than any other president, and his years in the legal profession were essential to his eventual election to the Presidency. As a lawyer, Lincoln knew how to craft successful closing arguments. As a president--with his Gettysburg Address, perhaps the greatest closing argument in history--he knew how to persuade a bitterly divided country into ultimately doing what was right for all. Through examples from Lincoln&amp;#39;s great speeches and closing arguments--included in their entirety are Lincoln&amp;#39;s First and Second Inaugural Speeches, the Gettysburg Address, the Emancipation Proclamation and more--this book instructs you in the art of persuasion in two simple ways: by providing lessons from Lincoln&amp;#39;s career as a lawyer and politician, and then by analyzing those lessons and discussing how to apply them to your own life. Lincoln&amp;#39;s Counsel gives important advice about advocacy straight from the very best.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
