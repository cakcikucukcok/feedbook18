  <title>Spy Who Came In From the Co-op - David Burke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On September 11th 1999 The Times newspaper carried the front page article &quot;Revealed: the quiet woman who betrayed Britain for 40 years. The spy who came in from the Co-op.&quot; Melita Norwood, thelast of the atomic spies, had finally been run to ground, but at 87 she was deemed too old to prosecute. Her crime: the shortening of the Soviet Union&#39;s atomic bomb project by up to 5 years. At atime when the world faces fresh dilemmas caused by the proliferation of nuclear weapons, this is the remarkable story of a much earlier drama. After the atomic bomb strikes on Hiroshima and Nagasakiin August 1945, British and American intelligence estimated the earliest date for the production of a Soviet bomb to be 1953. In fact, the Soviet Union went nuclear in 1948, and tested an atomic bombin 1949. The Soviet Union&#39;s bomb coincided with the onset of The Cold War, and threatened humankind with extinction. Melita Norwood was a member of one of those communist spy networks in America and Britain, who by guaranteeing those weapons of mass destruction threw down a challenge to America as sole superpower in the post-Second World War era. This fascinating book sets her in the context of the times, and uses her as a prism and focus through which to investigate the whole milieu.
