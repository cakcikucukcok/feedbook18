  <title>Viking History 3 in 1 - Bernard Hayes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A bundle of three audiobooks about the Viking history and mythology.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Book One: This audiobook is an in-depth look at the Viking Age, and the deeds and daily lives of these ancient, sometimes mysterious people. The Vikings of Scandinavia were heroic, adventurous, and often barbaric, but there can be no debate that they were also a people with big aspirations. Viking culture is still a topic of interest today, and this offers an insight into just how enduring their legacy is.&lt;br /&gt;
Book Two: In this audiobook,&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Norse Mythology: A Concise Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Sagas, Rituals, and Beliefs of Norse Mythology&lt;/i&gt;, the listener will be transported to the ancient customs of beliefs of the ancient Vikings of the North. This audiobook is dedicated to exploring the gods and goddesses that the Norse worshiped.&lt;br /&gt;
Book Three:&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;The Tale of a Viking Warrior King&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;delves into the mystery surrounding the Viking warrior who conquered European nations and became a king in his own right. Over nine centuries after the death of this great warrior, ancient poems, songs, and sagas about him still remain today. This audiobook considers the facts as we know them, the myths attributed to Ragnar, and the way this iconic heathen from the North continues to impact modern culture today." />
