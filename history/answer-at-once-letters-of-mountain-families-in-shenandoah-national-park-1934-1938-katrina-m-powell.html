  <title>&quot;Answer at Once&quot;: Letters of Mountain Families in Shenandoah National Park, 1934-1938 - Katrina M. Powell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With the Commonwealth of Virginia&#39;s Public Park Condemnation Act of 1928, the     state surveyed for and acquired three thousand tracts of land that would become Shenandoah     National Park. The Commonwealth condemned the homes of five hundred families so that their land     could be &quot;donated&quot; to the federal government and placed under the auspices of the National Park     Service. Prompted by the condemnation of their land, the residents began writing letters to     National Park and other government officials to negotiate their rights and to request various     services, property, and harvests. Typically represented in the popular media as lawless,     illiterate, and incompetent, these mountaineers prove themselves otherwise in this poignant     collection of letters. The history told by the residents themselves both adds to and counters     the story that is generally accepted about them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These letters are     housed in the Shenandoah National Park archives in Luray, Virginia, which was opened briefly to     the public from 2000 to 2002, but then closed due to lack of funding. This selection of roughly     150 of these letters, in their entirety, makes these documents available again not only to the     public but also to scholars, researchers, and others interested in the region&#39;s history, in the     politics of the park, and in the genealogy of the families. Supplementing the letters are     introductory text, photographs, annotation, and oral histories that further document the lives     of these individuals.&lt;/p&gt;" />
