  <title>Opening the American Mind: Recognizing the Threat to the Nation - Andrew P. O&#39;Meara Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Opening the American Mind is a history of our involvement in Vietnam and an examination of the communist models of revolution. OMearas report examines the impact of the War on the Vietnamese people and on the American Home Front He looks at the role of communist front organizations used to mobilize resistance in underdeveloped societies as well as more sophisticated fronts used to wage revolutionary warfare in industrialized societies.
The long march of the radical left through American colleges and universities established the support for the cause of International Socialism and communist revolutionaries in America. It was Marxist professors and fellow travelers, who wrote the one-sided historical accounts of American involvement in Vietnam justifying the cause of our enemies.
Colonel OMeara wraps up his survey of Americas stand in Vietnam by looking at communist front organizations operating behind the scenes here in America. His work is must reading for all Americans, especially young Americans seeking answers to questions concealed by politically correct control of higher education in America." />
