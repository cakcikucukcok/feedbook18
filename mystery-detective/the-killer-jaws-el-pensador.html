  <title>The Killer Jaws - El Pensador</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the sea there are many stories and legends that tell of tales of sea species that are too gruesome for some of us to even imagine. The elders speak of fish from hell. I&#39;m going to tell you an epic story of a sea monster with killer jaws that live in the swamp, the hidden marshes of Florida; this is the story of the giant piranha.
This is the story of a carnivorous fish one which doesnt stop until it knows there is nothing left not even a trace of flesh. Maybe their hunger has no quench, maybe they&#39;re nature&#39;s revenge mother natures way of saying keep out or maybe they just enjoy the misery and pain they cause. This is a recount of a horrific legend one that invades your mind unnerves your senses gives chills to your spine. The beast has caused the deaths of many people; it has tainted the waters so many times that red water in this region only seems natural, taking away every living being from its path. Many people have disappeared in the marshes, was it the piranhas, with their killer jaws, are all the legends real? Innocent people disappear, mourners left without bodies to cry or bury, children left without parents and parents left without children, they all have one thing in common they visited a river, a lagoon, or a swamp in which they did come in, but they did not come out.
The elders all speak but no one listens. No one pays attention to what the old people have to say, everyone rule out their stories a dementia or that its just a tall tale to get attention. Nobody believes in the sea creatures, in the river killers but i tell different I tell you to believe." />
