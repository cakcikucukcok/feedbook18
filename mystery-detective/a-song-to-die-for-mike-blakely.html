  <title>A Song to Die For - Mike Blakely</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Song to Die For -- &lt;/i&gt;a rousing tale mixing love, music, and mystery from Spur Award-winning author Mike Blakely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s 1975 and guitarist and singer/songwriter Creed Mason hopes to ride the new wave of Texas-style, Austin-based country music all the way back to the big time. A one-hit wonder whose Nashville career was cut short by a trip to Vietnam, Creed is desperate to get back into the business.  His break arrives when a country legend, Luster Burnett, comes out of a fifteen-year retirement for one last album and tour in order to pay off a huge debt to the I.R.S. As Luster&#39;s new guitarist and band manager, Creed jumps at the chance of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosa Martini, a beautiful young mob princess from Las Vegas, is found dead just outside of Austin. Texas Ranger Captain Hooley Johnson looks into the case, only to find a second young woman murdered--a friend of Rosa&#39;s. To complicate things, Rosa&#39;s adoptive brother, mob hit man Franco Martini, is spotted nosing around Austin in the wake of the murders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon it appears to Johnson, and to Creed, that the mob-related murders and the band are somehow connected.  When the band wins an unexpected booking at the biggest casino in Vegas, Creed begins to&lt;br&gt;wonder what kind of contract his band is being set up for--a major-label recording deal, or a mob hit? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
