  <title>It’S All Academic - David Fleming</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mark Carter barely has time to dump his personal belongings into his office in the administration building at Boan University when Dean Hartleys lifeless body is found lying in a pool of blood. A booming, narcissistic voice is silenced forever just as Carter is about to begin his new role as provost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While police roam the campus looking for clues as to who killed the dean, Carter attempts to seek out rationality in the often irrational world of higher education administration. Armed only with a sense of humor and an ancient cell phone, Carter steps into a universe of endless meetings, inflated egos, and inane policies and soon becomes disillusioned with a college administration more focused on a dunk-the-mascot event during spirit week than on a much-needed library renovation. The real mystery at Boan University is not, who killed Dean Hartley? Its how does anything get done and can Provost Carter survive? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Its All Academic&lt;/i&gt; presents a lighthearted and highly entertaining account of one mans ill-fated year as he immerses himself in the often unpredictable, image-building life that surrounds the world of higher education.&lt;/p&gt;" />
