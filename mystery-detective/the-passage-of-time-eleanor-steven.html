  <title>The Passage Of Time - Eleanor Steven</title>
      <meta name="description" content="June 2060&lt;br/&gt;
Maurice never knew his grandfather, Hansel Égoyan.&lt;br/&gt;
Divorced, unfaithful, lonely, dishonest: Maurice’s family certainly don’t lack in sarcastic comments when referring to him. Things change for Maurice the day he – by chance – discovers a letter written forty years earlier. It is addressed to his father and informs him of &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; father’s sudden death in prison.&lt;br/&gt;
He keeps the letter secretly, in his room. The aura of mystery surrounding his grandfather, whose face he doesn&#39;t even know, intrigues him more than ever.&lt;br/&gt;
Who exactly was Hansel? A simple watchmaker? Was he as dishonest and as unpleasant as his family claimed? Determined to find out and make up his own mind, he sails for Ispah.&lt;br/&gt;
There, in this remote and little-known country in the midst of an election campaign, Maurice gets dragged into the fight against the established power and uncovers a well-kept government secret. With the help of his new friends, Thibault and the beautiful Elvyne, he discovers an unusual society where time plays a very special role.&lt;br/&gt;" />
