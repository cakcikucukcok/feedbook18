  <title>The Angels&#39; Share - Ellen Crosby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ellen Crosby pours up another corking mystery with &lt;i&gt;The Angels&#39; Share&lt;/i&gt;, an intriguing blend of secret societies, Prohibition bootleg wine, and potentially scandalous documents hidden by the Founding Fathers, all of which yield a vintage murder. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Lucie Montgomery attends a Thanksgiving weekend party for friends and neighbors at Hawthorne Castle, an honest-to-goodness castle owned by the Avery family, the last great newspaper dynasty in America and owner of the &lt;i&gt;Washington Tribune&lt;/i&gt;, she doesn&#39;t expect the festive occasion to end in death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the party, Prescott Avery, the 95-year old family patriarch, invites Lucie to his fabulous wine cellar where he offers to pay any price for a cache of 200-year-old Madeira that her great-great-uncle, a Prohibition bootlegger, discovered hidden in the US Capitol in the 1920s. Lucie knows nothing about the valuable wine, believing her late father, a notorious gambler and spendthrift, probably sold or drank it.  By the end of the party Lucie and her fiancé, winemaker Quinn Santori, discover Prescott&#39;s body lying in his wine cellar. Is one of the guests a murderer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Lucie searches for the lost Madeira, which she believes links Prescott&#39;s death to a cryptic letter her father owned, she learns about Prescott&#39;s affiliation with the Freemasons. More investigating hints at a mysterious vault supposedly containing documents hidden by the Founding Fathers and a possible tie to William Shakespeare. If Lucie finds the long-lost documents, the explosive revelations could change history. But will she uncover a three hundred-year-old secret before a determined killer finds her?&lt;/p&gt;" />
