  <title>Elementary, She Read - Vicki Delany</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Gemma Doyle, a transplanted Englishwoman, has returned to the quaint town of West London on Cape Cod to manage her Great Uncle Arthur&#39;s Sherlock Holmes Bookshop and Emporium. The shop--located at 222 Baker Street--specializes in the Holmes canon and pastiche, and is also the home of Moriarty the cat. When Gemma finds a rare and potentially valuable magazine containing the first Sherlock Homes story hidden in the bookshop, she and her friend Jayne (who runs the adjoining Mrs. Hudson&#39;s Tea Room) set off to find the owner, only to stumble upon a dead body. &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The highly perceptive Gemma is the police&amp;#8217;s first suspect, so she puts her consummate powers of deduction to work to clear her name, investigating a handsome rare books expert, the dead woman&#39;s suspiciously unmoved son, and a whole family of greedy characters desperate to cash in on their inheritance. But when Gemma and Jayne accidentally place themselves at a second murder scene, it&#39;s a race to uncover the truth before the detectives lock them up for good.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fans of Sherlock Holmes will delight in the sleuthing duo of Gemma and Jayne in &lt;I&gt;Elementary, She Read&lt;/I&gt;, the clever and captivating series debut by nationally bestselling author Vicki Delany.&lt;/div&gt;" />
