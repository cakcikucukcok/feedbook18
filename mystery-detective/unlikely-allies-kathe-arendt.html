  <title>Unlikely Allies - Kathe Arendt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Karen wanted nothing more than to follow in her fathers footsteps and proudly serve as an agent with the FBI. She achieved her goal before her 22nd birthday but quickly learned the glamour of being an agent was very short lived. She made the toughest decision of her career after receiving a case with familiar players. Could she infiltrate a drug ring with her best friend in tow, or would the demands of her job bring an end to their friendship? Karens decision would be her last with the bureau; she resigned the position she loved rather than ruin her most important friendship. Her difficult decision left her unsure of her next steps. She landed a role managing security for The Excelsor, an exclusive Polo/Golf Club in Boca Raton. It was there she met the love of her life, James Caulfield III, and before their relationship was able to flourish, a tragedy almost ripped them apart. They set out on a dangerous trek to Brazil to solve a murder the police determined a suicide, and they had no idea they would align themselves with their most unlikely ally along the way." />
