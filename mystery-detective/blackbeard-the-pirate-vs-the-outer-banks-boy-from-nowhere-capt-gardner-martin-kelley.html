  <title>Blackbeard, the Pirate Vs the Outer Banks Boy from Nowhere - Capt. Gardner Martin Kelley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story happened between 1714 and 1718. In this story of mine, I have changed the way that Blackbeard was supposed to be killed and the story I have written just might be the way Blackbeard died.
&lt;p&gt;
I have tried to put together a story from what I have read and what I have learned on the waterways from my adventures and experiences of living and traveling on the water.
&lt;p&gt;
The Outer Banks are filled with the fruits of Gods larder. One had only to use skill and daring moves to survive in these days on the waterways.
&lt;p&gt;
The story starts as Blackbeard the pirate glared across the 
campfire. The boy hidden in the bushes that could not be seen was scared. There would be no mercy for him if he was discovered. He learned how to hide and spy on his enemies from the Indians on the Outer Banks. 
&lt;p&gt;
The boy had just turned 14 years old; he was looking across the fire at Blackbeard and is motley crew in the background. What his eyes focused on was the prettiest thing he had ever seen. She was partly dressed in a gown of blue and trimmed with silver. Her dark eyes flashed in defiance to what the pirate was saying. Her pretty red lips snarled in scorn, and how much ransom do you think you will get if you have your way with me, and then throw me to your crew?
&lt;p&gt;
The smoke from the fire baffled and the boy took this time to back away and get out of the bushes. He made himself a promise, he would free this captive for himself or his bones would lie forever in the sands along the shore. Now he would try to prove his manhood.&lt;br&gt;" />
