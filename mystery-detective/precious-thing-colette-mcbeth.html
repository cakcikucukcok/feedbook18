  <title>Precious Thing - Colette McBeth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I know her inside out.  I know what she&#39;s thinking, I know what she wants. So I can&#39;t give up on her, she knows I never will.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Some friendships fizzle out. Rachel and Clara promised theirs would last forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They met in high school when Rachel was the shy, awkward new girl and Clara was the friend everyone wanted. Instantly, they fell under one another&#39;s spell and nothing would be the same again. Now in their late twenties Rachel has the television career, the apartment and the boyfriend, while Clara&#39;s life is spiraling further out of control. Yet despite everything, they remain inextricably bound. Then Rachel&#39;s news editor assigns her to cover a police press conference, and she is shocked when she arrives to learn that the subject is Clara, reported missing. Is it abduction, suicide or something else altogether?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine discovering something about your oldest friend that forces you to question everything you&#39;ve shared together. The truth is always there.  But only if you choose to see it. In Colette McBeth&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Precious Thing&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
