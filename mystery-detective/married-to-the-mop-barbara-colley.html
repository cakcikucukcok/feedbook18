  <title>Married To The Mop - Barbara Colley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As owner of Maid for a Day, Charlotte LaRue is cleaning up New Orleans house by house. When it comes to hired help, she&#39;s the best there is, especially if murder runs in the family.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Though she&#39;s short two employees, Charlotte answers a desperate plea the weekend before Mardi Gras. A woman named Emily Rossi is hosting a huge bash for out-of-town guests, and just lost her maid to a family emergency. And Charlotte soon learns why. Emily&#39;s husband, Robert, just happens to be the most ruthless crime boss in the country. Nevertheless, Charlotte agrees to help at the Rossi family&#39;s costume ball when one of the servers comes down with the flu. She&#39;s beginning to think that the party is a cover for Robert&#39;s illegal activities, when the man himself is found dead in the library.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    The case seems cut-and-dried--to anyone but Charlotte, that is. Although Emily looks guilty as sin, Charlotte has seen enough of the Rossi family&#39;s dirty laundry to suspect everyone. But she&#39;d better tread carefully if she doesn&#39;t want to spend Fat Tuesday in the bayou, sleeping with the catfish.  .  .    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;b&gt;  Praise for Barbara Colley and her Charlotte LaRue Mysteries!  &lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &quot;Thoroughly enjoyable.&quot;  --&lt;i&gt;Mystery Scene&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;An appealingly down-to-earth sleuth. Fans of Southern cozies will enjoy.&quot;  --&lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &quot;.  .  .Charlotte LaRue will dust her way into readers&#39; hearts.  .  .&quot;  --&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;" />
