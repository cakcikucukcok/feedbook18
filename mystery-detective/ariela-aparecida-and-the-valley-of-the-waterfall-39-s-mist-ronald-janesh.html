  <title>Ariela Aparecida and the Valley of the Waterfall&#39;s Mist - Ronald  Janesh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a world filled with magic and mystery, young people can be inspired to succeed. Such is the message of the Brazilian children&#39;s classic, Ariela Aparecida and the Valley of the Waterfall&#39;s Mist.Within this magical forest setting, young Ariela Aparecida lives in the mountainous Brazilian interior. She is absorbed by the life of the vineyard that sustains her family&#39;s village, toiling each day to care for the vines and learn the secrets of their growth.One day, she is visited by a phantom samba dancer, who appears in the mist from the waterfalls. The phantom leaves Ariela with a silvery hoe and pruning shears, and the warning that she will soon be tested. That night, a giant owl flies to the foot of her bed, taking Ariela and her tools atop his wings for a flight to the forest&#39;s edge. There she meets an ancient grapevine that reveals secrets and sets Ariela to a task that will save the vineyard from destruction.The vine commands her to clear obstructions at the source of the valley&#39;s waterfalls high up in the mountains. She must free the waterfall flow and be back in bed by dawn." />
