  <title>Now May You Weep - Deborah Crombie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Newly appointed Detective Inspector Gemma James has never thought to question her friend Hazel Cavendish about her past. So it is quite a shock when Gemma learns that their holiday retreat to a hotel in the Scottish Highlands is, in fact, Hazel&#39;s homecoming -- and that fellow guest Donald Brodie was once Hazel&#39;s lover, despite a vicious, long-standing feud between their rival, fine whiskey distilling families. And the fires of a fierce and passionate affair may not have burned out completely -- on Brodie&#39;s part at least, since he&#39;s prepared to destroy Hazel&#39;s marriage to win back his &quot;Juliet.&quot; But when a sudden, brutal murder unleashes a slew of sinister secrets and long-seething hatreds, putting Hazel&#39;s life in peril, Gemma knows she will need help unraveling this very bloody knot -- and calls for the one man she trusts more than any other, Duncan Kincaid, to join her far from home ... and in harm&#39;s way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
