      <meta name="description" content="Theres a one-of-a-kind ring in a safe-deposit box that a man named Alder wants his hands on, so he and his mute younger brother take hostage the owner of the ring, Jack, and his so-called girlfriend, Eva. The older Alder threatens to harm Eva unless Jack brings him the ring. After several nerve-racking hours, they all come to understand the ring is missing from the safe-deposit box. The Alder brothers disappear with Eva, leaving Jack alone. Within a very fast time, the situation gets complicated and even confusing, yet someone needs to simplify it. When law enforcement is brought in, veteran detective Mark Dockett is assigned the case along with his protg, investigator Keelie Moraco. It doesnt take long before suspicious things happen, including a fair share of double-dealing that cause Moraco to suspect a startling truthcorruption in law enforcement. When she thinks shes gathered enough evidence to solve the ring heist and expose the corruption, something out of the blue happens that changes her mind and her allegiance forever. It seems everyone has at least one closely held secret they wont let go." />
