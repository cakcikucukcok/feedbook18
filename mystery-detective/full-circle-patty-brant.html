Oxbow has always felt charmed to Mollythat is, if she doesnt count the ghostly visitors who turn her world upside down or the recent return of her ex-boyfriend Greg Richards, who brings with him the scourge of illicit drugs and a burning need to get even with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molly is working on acquainting her best friend Dana with Denniss memory. He is the father Dana has never known but always resented.
