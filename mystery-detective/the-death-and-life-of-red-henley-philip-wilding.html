  <title>The Death and Life of Red Henley - Philip Wilding</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Meet Detective Louis Green, the strangely gifted socialite Robert Walker who stalks Manhattan’s upper reaches, the Rev James Bulley sequestered away in his Soho basement calling God down to wash away the sins of the world and Red Henley, a presence rarely seen, but never out of sight.  Red’s murder sets Green on a path of self-discovery if not redemption. As 1980 unfurls, Green discovers a direct line back from modern day New York City to a religious commune in the Tennessee countryside decades earlier and the story of two boys housed there who would experience a horrific tragedy that would become the spark that sets the fire in the towers and backstreets of Manhattan some twenty years later.  As he follows the killer’s trail, Green finds a city filled with murderous deeds, the corrupting influence of absolute power and the madness that both love and faith can bring. With one question remaining: what draws Bulley, Walker and Red together?  As the clouds gather over the city, we find men strung up in trees like broken kites, one pushed from the roof of his own building, another gagged, his teeth broken by a pool ball pushed down his throat. But in this bloody landscape stands Green trying to not only to understand this ever evolving case, but the nature of evil and the intractable battle between the good and the bad within himself. How life is sometimes lived on a plane of existence outside of our own and the everyday magic that can manifest in the most unexpected places.  With the end of the year fast approaching, Green returns to the now refurbished warehouse for a bloody resolution and a reckoning that unites killer and cop in a macabre and almost intimate dance that draws them together before pulling them forever apart." />
