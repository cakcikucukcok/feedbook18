  <title>The Rage Mystery Series Bundle: Includes Lethal Rage and Savage Rage - Brent Pilkey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Lethal Rage&lt;/B&gt; follows the journey of Jack Warren, a young Toronto police officer, as he enters the dangerous streets of downtown&#39;s 51 Division.&amp;#160; Accustomed to the white-bread policing of his previous division, Jack is staggered when he first arrives at his new job. No TV show or movie prepared him for the reality of 51, where the officers wade through the filth of humanity on a daily &amp;#8211; hourly &amp;#8211; basis. Warren is immediately thrown into a war between the cops of 51 and a new crack cocaine dealer intent on taking over the downtown drug trade.&amp;#160; No one is safe from the dealer&#39;s quest for domination and soon the war becomes horrifically personal for Jack.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In &lt;B&gt;Savage Rage&lt;/B&gt;, Jack Warren finds himself transferred to 53 Division &amp;#8212; known as the &quot;Sleepy Hollow of Toronto&quot; &amp;#8212; after the murder of his partner. He yearns to return to 51 Division, where his former colleagues are busy pursuing a criminal mastermind. Randall Kayne has been committing violent, bloody crimes that are hitting close to home in 51 Division, yet he manages to stay just one step ahead of the police. Although Jack&#39;s wife wants him to leave the force entirely, an old enemy soon drags him into the Kayne case against his will, forcing a confrontation with Kayne that only one of them can survive.&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
