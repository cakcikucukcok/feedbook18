  <title>The Prostitutes&#39; Ball - Stephen J. Cannell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Detective Shane Scully responds to a call in the Hollywood hills at a once-immaculate mansion, the scene of an infamous murder twenty-five years prior. He discovers the remnants of a lavish pool party. The revelers have fled, leaving three dead bodies in their wake, all shot with the same gun. One is an acclaimed film producer. The other two, a pair of gorgeous women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his new partner, Sumner &quot;Hitch&quot; Hitchens, Scully begins to investigate what looks to be an open-and-shut case: The women were hired prostitutes, and there&#39;s security video of an angry husband firing on all three. A simple case of brutal revenge. But nothing is ever as simple as it seems: There&#39;s a single spent bullet casing that doesn&#39;t match the rest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From that single bullet emerges a story of love, murder, suicide, and one of the biggest financial frauds in L.A. history. Someone has gone to great lengths to cover up a decades-old crime, and as Scully and Hitch get closer to the answer, they find themselves in a killer&#39;s crosshairs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
