  <title>The Poacher&#39;s Son - Paul Doiron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For only $6.99: Paul Doiron&#39;s&lt;i&gt; The Poacher&#39;s Son&lt;/i&gt; is a sterling debut of literary suspense. Taut and engrossing, it represents the first in a series featuring Mike Bowditch.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Set in the wilds of Maine, this is an explosive tale of an estranged son thrust into the hunt for a murderous fugitive--his own father&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Game warden Mike Bowditch returns home one evening to find an alarming voice from the past on his answering machine: his father Jack, a hard drinking womanizer who makes his living poaching illegal game. An even more frightening call comes the next morning from the police: they are searching for the man who killed a beloved local cop the night before--and his father is their prime suspect. Jack has escaped from police custody, and only Mike believes that his tormented father might not be guilty. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, alienated from the woman he loves, shunned by colleagues who have no sympathy for the suspected cop-killer, Mike must come to terms with his haunted past. He knows firsthand Jack&#39;s brutality, but is the man capable of murder? Desperate and alone, he strikes up an uneasy alliance with a retired warden pilot, and together the two men journey deep into the Maine wilderness in search of a runaway fugitive. But the only way for Mike to save his father is to find the real killer--which could mean putting everyone he loves in the line of fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;*BONUS CONTENT: This edition of &lt;i&gt;The Poacher&#39;s Son&lt;/i&gt; includes a new introduction from the author and a discussion guide.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
