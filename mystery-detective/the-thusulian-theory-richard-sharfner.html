  <title>The Thusulian Theory - Richard Sharfner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This novel is an exhilarating story of a group of Black Americans led by one man who travels the nation to establish a National Afro-American Society.  The oppositions they encounters from government and racists both in and outside the government provide many obstacles to overcome.  Intrigues and murder within the Society add to the groups troubles.
Dresden Macomb, the leader, is a determined man and he fights on, building a cadre of associates who help him structure the Society for the betterment of blacks everywhere.  The Regional Centers of the Afro-American Society houses Community Centers for unrestricted assistance to blacks and the needy. The Societys aim was to clear the welfare rolls of America and provide meaningful jobs, education and health benefits for the nations forgotten. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dresden wanted to build the Afro-American Society to give blacks pride and self-respect.  He had known the depravity of living poor and in the South.  He had seen the mistreatment and discrimination of people in the South.  His mothers family was victims of this mistreatment and he sought to rectify all the ills of a society that could denigrate its citizens. He wanted desperately to find some means whereby the black citizens of the United States could be respected and appreciated by the entire country.  The search for this unifying commodity was fraught with suspense and foreboding. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dresden was introduced to a leader and emissary of the Church world, David Kristaff, who wanted to join forces with the Society and present a united front: the Christian world, with their Community Centers and the Afro-American Society combining all their resources to lift all blacks out of poverty.  This International Christian Church worked in African on scientific experiments in the field of medicine and gene alterations.  David Kristaff was a fountain of inspiration and a buttress for Dresden Macomb as he battled the forces around him that sought to destroy the Society. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Mounting intrigue within the Society and governmental harassment from Washington D.C. kept the Society reeling from suspicions, attacks and assassinations.  The CIA was secretly active in trying to get the medical and scientific information that the Society had developed by any means possible.  Those in government who oppose the Society demand Congressional hearings about the supposed plots and espionage of the Society.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Congressional hearings were filled with caustic acrimony, drama and explosive revelations.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
During the Congressional hearings Senators who were friendly to the Society uncovered a plot in the higher echelons of the Armed Forces to overthrow the government of the United States of America.  The Society was enlisted to be the eyes and ears of the United States Government.  Since blacks were virtually in all levels of the Armed Forces and throughout government they provided a ready network of secret agents for those who supported the Constitution of the United States. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
         The Societys work in the African Scientific Academy, stationed in Zaire, hit pay dirt when an incredible discovery was made.   In a little village far up in the hills of Zaire, isolated unto themselves, an astonishing tribe of people with an amazing gene property was uncovered.  The scientist of the African Scientific Academy developed this remarkable gene discovery into The Thusulian Theory. This scientific theory brought benefit to all mankind.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
             The plot to overthrow the government was aborted. The military plotters with their Congressional backers were exposed and arrested.  Finally the worth of the Afro-American Society was firmly established." />
