  <title>A Nip of Murder - Carol Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As Daisy McGovern knows all too well, it isn&#39;t easy being a young, small-town waitress at a local diner in Virginia. It becomes even harder as she&#39;s trying to stitch her life back together and salvage her job by converting the diner into a bakery. She&#39;s preoccupied with snickerdoodles and cinnamon buns, trying to feed a group of geocachers in town, when a mysterious robbery occurs in the back room and one of the thieves ends up dead with a chef&#39;s knife in his chest. With the sheriff out of town, Daisy, distrustful of the cop left in charge, takes it upon herself to follow up on clues and find out who the robber was and why he was there. While she&#39;s investigating, she meets a handsome geocacher and is commissioned to bake a cake for the unlikely wedding of one of the Balsam boys, at the same time trying to avoid the charms of his moonshine-brewing brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a second murder occurs, Daisy finds herself in a twisted game of cat and mouse that takes her from secretive nip joints overflowing with moonshine to weathered Appalachian mountaintops overflowing with history and guns. She must figure out who is the murderer and how her bakery is involved before she becomes the next victim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Nip of Murder&lt;/i&gt; is the second entry in this charming series filled with eccentric characters, red herrings, and, of course, moonshine! Carol Miller hits all the right notes, creating a unique mystery that will delight as well as surprise.&lt;/p&gt;" />
