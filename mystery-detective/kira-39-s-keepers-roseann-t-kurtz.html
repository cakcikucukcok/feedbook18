  <title>Kira&#39;s Keepers - Roseann T. Kurtz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kira was a beautiful young woman in the prime of her life, with an ended marriage, a young daughter Rebecca, who was ready to explore life as a gypsy and domineering mother who never minced words or showed love and compassion to her daughter as Kira so much needed to hear from a mom. Seeing no need to stay in the New Jersey town she grew up in, with no ties or obligations to anybody, she decided to venture out on the road to find the new beginnings. While traveling alone, she only got as far as Virginia when she met the company of Travis Monahan. A much younger man than her but seemed to have a kind hear and a deep interest in her. But would this be a trap, true love, blind faith, or fate? Reluctant, she started to build a relationship with this handsome young man who came from a very wealthy family, well known in town.
She did not know as she began to fall in love that this wonderful, kind-hearted man would change her world and her life forever, quite literally.
A book that will keep you spellbound with every twist and turn, a page-turner with several surprises that will keep you holding on breathless to find the real Kira." />
