  <title>The Washington Stratagem - Adam LeBor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this new international thriller from the author of &lt;em&gt;The Geneva Option&lt;/em&gt;, UN covert negotiator Yael Azoulay is drawn into a web of betrayal and intrigue that leads from deep within America&amp;#39;s military-industrial complex to the Middle East and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yael Azoulay went rogue in Geneva and nearly lost her life; although her physical wounds are healed, she will never be able to forget what happened. Now back in New York, when the secretary-general asks her to meet with the CEO of the Prometheus Group, a lobbying and asset management firm with extensive links to the Pentagon and dubious business interests in the volatile Middle East, she cannot refuse his request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working under Prometheus&amp;#39;s radar, Yael uncovers a chilling conspiracy with ties to Iran . . . and to a shocking source from her past. The end game is nothing less than a devastating&amp;#8212;and very lucrative&amp;#8212;new war in the Middle East. But the closer she comes to the truth, the more Yael begins to expose herself, revealing a life riddled with secrets. As she confronts the ghosts of her past, the few certainties of her life begin to crumble around her, laying bare a terrifying truth: that she has enormously powerful enemies who neither forgive, nor forget.&lt;/p&gt;" />
