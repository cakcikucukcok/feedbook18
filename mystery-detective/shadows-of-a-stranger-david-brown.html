  <title>Shadows of a Stranger - David Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lilian McGuiness returns to bury her husband. Following the murder of William, she is determined to find out who killed him and why. After searching through his possessions, she realises that she had never really known the only man she had ever loved. 
Detective Inspectors Luke Naylor and Scott Reed return to try and solve the murder. This time they are working closely with a new team. With the help of Stacey Calvert and Phil Moxon, they are determined to uncover the truth. Family secrets, kidnap, blackmail, and revenge are all on the cards.
When four other men are murdered, from Monte Carlo to Madrid, Interpols Antoine Chouzenoux must put his own guilty secret to the back of his mind and concentrate on leading the investigation to catch the faceless assassin, sweeping Europe.
From the darkness, the killer steps out from the shadows to settle a score. They have no choice other than to carry out the hit or become a target.
High stakes and corruption lead Stacey and Luke to Krakow where a wrong decision almost costs Stacey her life. There is one person who may hold the answers. By betraying her own family, she finds she has no other option than to sacrifice her past and assist the police. 
Lilian must stay strong and fight to find out the identity of her husbands killer. She decides to take matters into her own hand, putting her own life at risk. In a deadly game of cat and mouse, Lilian comes face-to-face with the killer in a fatal finale; only one of them can survive.
The much-anticipated sequel to Never Trust a Stranger." />
