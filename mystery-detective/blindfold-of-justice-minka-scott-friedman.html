  <title>Blindfold of Justice - Minka Scott-Friedman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;In the late forties and early fifties, Beverly Hills was a small, conservative community with safe, tree lined streets, and was famous for movie stars and one lawyer - the fabled Jerry Geisler. This book is a fictionalized, but authentic, inside view of the workings of his office, and his world, seen through the eyes of his associate counsel. Everything is there, including allies and adversaries in the L.A.P.D., the Press, and the L.A. County District Attorneys office.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;In those days, criminal cases were defended on the merits, not by invoking intellectually dishonest technicalities concerning police procedure. It was an honest, rockem, sockem, intellectual battle, and may the smartest, or luckiest, lawyer win.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Here we have a rising star in a prestigious Beverly Hills law firm defending a wealthy playboy accused of the brutal slaying of his estranged wife. His adversary is a brilliant young prosecutor who wants the D.A.s job, and will stop at nothing to get it.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;The resolution of this conflict involves forensic pathology, psychology, incest, drugs, and lots of dirty tricks by the police and both attorneys. To top it all off, the final courtroom scene takes place in a unique and unexpected venue.&lt;/P&gt;" />
