  <title>A Welcome Grave - Michael Koryta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sometime after midnight, on a moonless October night turned harsh by a fine, windswept rain, one of the men I liked least in the world was murdered in a field near Bedford, just south of the city....The detectives went looking for suspects--- people whose histories with Jefferson were adversarial and hostile. At the top of that list, they found me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So begins &lt;i&gt;A Welcome Grave,&lt;/i&gt; the third novel by award-winning mystery writer Michael Koryta, featuring private investigator Lincoln Perry. Once a rising star on the Cleveland police force, Perry ended his career when he left one of the city&#39;s prominent attorneys, Alex Jefferson, bleeding in the parking lot of his country club---retribution for his affair with Perry&#39;s fiancée.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Jefferson is dead, the victim of a brutal murder, and his widow has called upon Perry for a favor he knows he shouldn&#39;t accept but can&#39;t turn down: to find Jefferson&#39;s estranged son, partial beneficiary of the dead man&#39;s fortune. The case is simple enough, a routine &quot;locate,&quot; and he&#39;ll be paid plenty of money for the work. The encounter should be simple, too: a brief exchange of information and maybe an empty condolence before Perry gets back into his truck and returns home. Instead, he&#39;s loaded into a police car and taken to a rural jail while Jefferson&#39;s son is zipped into a body bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perry soon learns that Jefferson&#39;s millions are the target of a thirst for revenge that hasn&#39;t been satisfied by blood. As a pair of deadly assailants push deep into the investigator&#39;s life, they bring with them police from two states who are determined to see Perry in jail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on the skill that prompted the &lt;i&gt;Toronto Sun&lt;/i&gt; to call him &quot;one of America&#39;s best young mystery writers,&quot; Michael Koryta makes &lt;i&gt;A Welcome Grave &lt;/i&gt;an intense exploration of the lengths to which a desperate man is forced to go in order to clear his name and solve a crime. This is a thrilling new book that justifies the critical acclaim and solidifies his role as an emerging talent among today&#39;s top writers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
