  <title>The Man Who Fought Alone - Stephen R. Donaldson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the sprawling new novel &lt;i&gt;The Man Who Fought Alone&lt;/i&gt;, Stephen R. Donaldson tells a tale of a hero&#39;s dark night of the soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mick Axbrewder has enough problems to kill any ten lesser men. He&#39;s a recovering alcoholic. He&#39;s also healing--painfully and slowly--from a gunshot wound that nearly killed him. His old partner, Ginny, seems to want as little to do with him as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years ago, he and Ginny worked side by side. That was before he accidentally shot and killed a cop. While drunk. A cop who happened to be his brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Axbrewder--&quot;Brew&quot; to his friends--is trying to make his way back to self-respect. It isn&#39;t easy. It doesn&#39;t help that Ginny has moved them to the sprawling, heartless Sunbelt city of Carner, where he can&#39;t get the &quot;feel&quot; of the streets. At least he has work, handling security in the booming martial-arts industry centered in Carner. A world of modern commercial competition and ancient resentments. A world with hidden stakes, over which someone is evidently willing to kill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Brew&#39;s real job isn&#39;t the one for which he&#39;s been hired. His real job is regaining his own self-respect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
