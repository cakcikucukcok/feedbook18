Box, #1 NYT bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Disappeared&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice Moore is just beginning to think his troubles are behind him. He&amp;#8217;s found a job protecting a remote forest preserve in Virginian Appalachia where his main responsibilities include tracking wildlife and refurbishing cabins.&amp;#160;It&amp;#8217;s hard work, and totally solitary&amp;#8212;perfect to hide away from the Mexican drug cartels he betrayed back in Arizona.&amp;#160;But when Rice finds the carcass of a bear killed on the grounds, the quiet solitude he&amp;#8217;s so desperately sought is suddenly at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More bears are killed on the preserve and Rice&amp;#8217;s obsession with catching the poachers escalates, leading to hostile altercations with the locals and attention from both the law and Rice&amp;#8217;s employers. Partnering with his predecessor, a scientist who hopes to continue her research on the preserve, Rice puts into motion a plan that could expose the poachers but risks revealing his own whereabouts to the dangerous people he was running from in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James McLaughlin expertly brings the beauty and danger of Appalachia to life.&amp;#160;The result is an elemental, slow burn of a novel&amp;#8212;one that will haunt you long after you turn the final page.&lt;/p&gt;" />
