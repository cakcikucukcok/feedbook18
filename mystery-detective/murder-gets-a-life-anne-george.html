  <title>Murder Gets a Life - Anne George</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Patricia Anne can&#39;t imagine why Mary Alice is in such an uproar over her son Ray&#39;s new bride. Sunshine Dabbs is Ucute as can be,&amp;#34; even if she is a bit unconventional, which should hardly come as a shock to Mary Alicc given that she&#39;s the one who raised her boy. But with all her motherly instincts, Mary Alice is sure that this sweet little blonde Barbie doll--who met her son in Bora Bora after she won the trip on Wheel of Fortune--thinks she&#39;s found herself a fortune in Ray&#39;s hefty wallet. &lt;p&gt;The sisters can&#39;t wait to get a look at Sunshine&#39;s family, and quite a look it turns out to be. As soon as Meemaw Turkett invites Mary Alice and Patricia Anne into her cozy trailer on the family compound they stumble over a corpse, and Meemaw&#39;s best hog butchering knife is stuck in its chest. Meemaw, a Cabbage Patch look-alike and Sunshine&#39;s grandmother, guardian, and the family matriarch is shocked to pieces and immediately summons the family to her trailer. Pawpaw, a lovable bearded grump has his own trailer, and their grown kids each enjoy a private home-away-from-home on the five-trailer compound. &lt;p&gt;The discovery of the mysterious body brings in Mary Alice&#39;s nemesis, good ol&#39; boy Sheriff Reuse, who, she knows from her experience at the Skoot &#39;n&#39; Boot, is nothing but trouble. Within minutes, the compound is strewn with a weird collection of friends, neighbors and relatives. There&#39;s Meemaw&#39;s spooky channeler, ready to give guidance as needed; Sunshine&#39;s jilted boyfriend skulking around; a bunch of dogs ready to attack...and Kerrigan, Sunshine&#39;s mostly absentee mama, who stars in the kind of video flicks that might even shock Mary Alice. &lt;/p&gt;Patricia Anne can&#39;t imagine why Mary Alice is in such an uproar over her son Ray&#39;s new bride.
