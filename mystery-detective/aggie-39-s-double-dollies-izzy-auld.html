  <title>Aggie&#39;s Double Dollies - Izzy Auld</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Somebody feels threatened by Aggie&#39;s commitment to researching and writing the family history. Leaving threatening phone calls, emails, and faxes, the bad guy doesn&#39;t give up. Hiring a killer, a neophyte bad guy, this stalker trails Aggie and her double cousin to France, and on a river cruise, and then on a cross-country drive. The problem-what sort of scandal occured in the recent or distant past to send a family member on such a deadly quest? What could Aggie possibly uncover that&#39;s so awful as to require murder most foul? Aggie&#39;s research takes her and Lisa back to the past on a historical adventure, where we see the settling of the west, particularly Wyoming, through the eyes of the cousins&#39; great-great-grandmothers. Meanwhile, in this day and age, one wonders what in the world possessed another cousin to marry a real loser, a teller turned bank VP after marrying the secretary of state. Also, Aggie&#39;s generation of cousins are bent on playing cupid, except they&#39;re in conflict about whom and why. Should they push Senator Steve Norman at Cousin Nasty, or devise romantic scenarios for Steve with Nicole, Aggie&#39;s granddaughter? These two sub-plots get in the way of Aggie&#39;s quest, one of which contributes to her search and her desperate efforts to save her own life, and the other sub-plot of which must inevitably foil the primary plot. (Aggie&#39;s Double Dollies, more than any other of the Aggie Morissey mysteries, helps to unravel the family saga)" />
