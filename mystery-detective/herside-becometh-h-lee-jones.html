  <title>Herside Becometh - H.Lee Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a story about a very confusing young lady who relishes torment but disallows tenderness. When Born, her boyfriend, pushes her around and humiliates her, she submits to his abuse, but when Plus, another admirer, wants to advance with kindness, she responds with resentment. Is she in search of love, or does she love to be insulted? Born was upset at Diane because she stopped to talk with some friends. When they were in the hall of their building, he grasped the back of her neck with a firm grip and berated her, Who the fuck you think you are! You dont stop and talk to nobody when you with me, bitch! I ought to fuck your dumb ass up right now. Then he shoved her ahead with the heavy grocery bags in her arms. Later on Dianes admirer named Plus came by and caught her by surprise. Plus was really fond of Diane, telling her, Stop apologizing for everything, and stop bending over backward trying to appease a headache. Youre trying too hard to make this guy comfortable, and its not going to happen! Diane was somber as she responded, Man, your saying all the right things. I really do appreciate it too. Plus stopped her, saying, Look, Diane, you dont have to be a fool for this dude. Just let me see you sometime just to talk, and I have no problem removing trash. Suddenly Born angrily burst out of the building looking fierce as he glared at Plus, who returned the gaze. Diane froze in fear looking up at Born with bulging eyes. Plus and Born were about to clash when Diane stepped between them, shouting, Stop! Stop! Dont fight, I said! She turned to face Plus. Plus, what are you doing? Just what the hell are you doing? I dont wanna talk to you! You should have just kept going by. I know what I can do, and I know I dont want you. Born is my man, and I dont ever want talk to you again, okay. Dont come around here picking a fight with my man over me because youre not all that, now, bye! She went into the building leaving Plus standing by the stoop, and he was stunned by the event." />
