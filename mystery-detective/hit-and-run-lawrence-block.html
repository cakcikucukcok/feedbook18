      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For years now Keller&#39;s had places to go and people to kill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But enough is enough. Just one more job&amp;#8212;paid in advance&amp;#8212;and he&#39;s going to retire. Waiting in Des Moines for the client&#39;s go-ahead, Keller&#39;s picking out stamps for his collection at a shop in Urbandale when somebody guns down the charismatic governor of Ohio. Back at his motel, Keller sees the killer&#39;s face broadcast on TV. A face he&#39;s seen quite often. Every morning. In the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keller calls his associate Dot in White Plains, but there&#39;s no answer. He&#39;s stranded halfway across the country, and every cop in America has just seen his picture. His ID and credit cards are no longer good, and he just spent almost all of his cash on the stamps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now what?&lt;/p&gt;" />
