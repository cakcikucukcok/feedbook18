  <title>The Gumdrop House Affair - Timony McKeever</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Jewish&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Accountant chokes on a Polish Sausage&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;in a City Park...A young Catholic Priest is found on his bed wearing only his collar and a dead&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Gay Hooker&amp;quot; is hanging from his ceiling&lt;/strong&gt;...The body of a Mafia&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Construction Baron&amp;quot; is found in the parking lot of the Diocese of Denver...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s obvious that Denver Homicide Detectives, Sargent Jack Laskey and his partner Detective Mai Li McDuff would become involved with these events, but&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;how does Father William Yeats Butler of the Franciscan Order become totally involved in every one of these events&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and more with his ex-Partner Jack Laskey.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An African American standing 6&amp;#39;5&amp;quot;and weighing 315 pounds of muscle, Father William Butler is an imposing figure in the robes of a Franciscan Priest.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Father William has always been known as &amp;quot;The Monk&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;because of his&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;devout Catholic faith&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;when he was an All American Linebacker at Notre Dame or as a Narcotics and Homicide Detective for the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;ten years that he and Laskey were Partners.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;In the tenth year of his police career, the Monk felt a calling to the Priesthood&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;because as&amp;nbsp;a Police Officer, he was only dealing with the spiritual symptoms of humanity&amp;#39;s illness not the real cause of the illness,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;the Devil&amp;#39;s influence&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;on common man. The Monk had&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;an acute and powerful awareness of the Devil&amp;#39;s presence&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;- not a &amp;quot;6th Sense&amp;quot;, but a powerful gift from God.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Devil, who the Monk calls &amp;quot;The Ugly&amp;quot;, is now and always has been active on Capitol Hill. In&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Gumdrop House Affair&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;many of his deceptions and ploys are revealed as the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Monk and his faith stand against the &amp;quot;Wickedness and the snares of the Devil.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will fall in love&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;with Father Augustus O&amp;#39;Shea, Aunt Rhoda, Popcan Charlie, Paisley Bob Lewis, Frank the English Bulldog and all the people who visit St. Benedict the Moor Catholic Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Gumdrop House Affair&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;deals with the recent sex scandals in the Catholic Church and the effects in an honest blue collar layman&amp;#39;s fashion.&lt;strong&gt;Written by a Veteran Cop&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;the pace is&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;fast, violent, profane, humorous and honest.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;A tribute to the men and women who give all to stay true to their Vows and Oaths as they protect a cynical public and a decaying culture.&lt;/p&gt;" />
