  <title>Decker&#39;s Log - John G. Denham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have written three short Stories involving characters developed from The Assistant, a sea story, my earlier work. The principles, Florence and John Decker are not a youthful married couple or are they your typical man and wife. Their backgrounds are as different as day and night but function better than any oyster movement.
Captain John Decker spent most of his adult life at sea; a decorated career naval officer and later as a Licensed Master Mariner in command of a modern containership. His gregorious life style and good living was truncated by an unwilling physcial plant that had enough. Bent, but not broken, John survived and was offered a job ashore by his employer in a less responsible position with comensurate benefits. Life changed and so did John. Never a brilliant leader or exciting entrepreneur he is successful because he thinks logically and communicates well. He would be outstanding if he knew what he was doing. He has survived 8 years in a middle-management role and at age 65 planned to retire. Now married and relatively settled down John plans to become a partner with Flo in a fledgling business, Inquiry Associates.
Flo, a lawyer, ex FBI Special Agent and a state Judge has found her true place as head of IA, Inc. Started as a confidential consulting business it quickly evolved into a problem solving legal-investigation resource for the U.S. Government and related friends. As the brains of the organization Flo has numerous friends, acquaintances and people she knows and people that know her on both sides of the law. One word-describes her: integrety.
The Deckers try to live a normal life. They are frequently drawn astray by well meaning friends and others that need their special help.
This compendium relates to only three episodes in the life and struggles of Florence and John Decker of 1A, Inc., and their daily attempt to normally exist.
	BOMB A WEIGH: John and Florence Decker try the good life only to be trapped in a national emergency that verges on catastrophe. A small effective and efficient team of government and public volunteers react and with unexpected assistance battle time to seek solution.
THE FATHERS: The Deckers are involved in investigating an international crime threat that if expanded can destroy governments and corrupt nations. A quickly organized response team by-passes procedures and attacks processes head-on. The enemy is determined to be more powerful and corrupt than the existing rules can manage, therefore a unique process and people are involved in the resolution.
THE PRIZE: The past catches up with John Decker and a friend asks for assistance in a delicate matter involving an Asian nation. Each development creates a bigger problem. Political and international organized forces oppose and interfere at each opportunity. The friends of the Deckers respond and short-circuit processes and reach out to international leaders for help. The Inquiry Associates, Inc., is in over its head until the U.S. Government is forced to be involved; the tide quickly turns as the professionals act." />
