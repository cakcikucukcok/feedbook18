  <title>Translucence: Everything That’S Dark - Jeremy Stevens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Its been roughly two years since Jason Braswells former high school buddy, Brian Dildy, was convicted of DUI vehicular manslaughter. Jason, now twenty and a sophomore in college, is drinking more heavily than ever. The apartment he shares with roommates is filled with a gallery of beer bottles, cards, quarters, shot glasses, and dice.
The snow is falling on a Sunday afternoon when Jason and his housemate crack open their first beer, long before the party at the Sugar Magnolia gig at Crossroads Bar. As the snowfall turns to a whiteout, Jason chews an OxyContin, sending his entire existence spiraling to a shockingly absurd bottom peppered with intriguing characters that include his undergraduate girlfriend, a cop, a porn star, a rugby player, and a gangster who all converge into the dark decay caused by the addicted life.
In this compelling novel, the grim realities of alcohol and narcotics abuse are brought to the forefront through a young mans eyes as he battles personal demons and chooses his future." />
