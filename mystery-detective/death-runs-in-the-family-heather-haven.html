  <title>Death Runs in the Family - Heather Haven</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lee Alvarez&amp;rsquo; ex-husband, Nick -- a man she divorced with joy in her heart and a gun in her hand &amp;ndash; sprints back in her life only to disappear again. She&amp;rsquo;d love to leave it at that, but could he be responsible for the recent death of her cousin, who keeled over at the finish line of a half-marathon in front of hundreds of spectators? As PI for the family run business, Discretionary Inquiries, Lee follows the clues to Vegas, where she joins forces with Shoshone PI, Flint Tall Trees.&amp;nbsp; Together they uncover a multi-million dollar betting syndicate, a tacky lounge lizard act, and a list of past but very dead runners, plus future ones to off. At the top of the &amp;lsquo;future&amp;rsquo; list is the love of her life, Gurn Hanson. Hoping to force the culprits out in the open, Gurn and Lee&amp;rsquo;s brother, Richard, vow to run San Francisco&amp;rsquo;s famous Palace to Palace 12K in only a few days. Can Lee keep the two men she loves from hitting the finish line like her cousin? With more at stake than she ever dreamed possible, Lee is in a battle against time to stop the Alvarez Family&amp;rsquo;s race with death. Book Three of the Alvarez Family Murder Mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;" />
