  <title>Cold Hit - Stephen J. Cannell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What if, under the PATRIOT Act, federal bureaucrats could take murder cases away from local cops--then bury those cases so they&#39;re never investigated again? &lt;br&gt;What if government agents could bug your home, your car, your place of business--&lt;i&gt;your entire life&lt;/i&gt;--with nothing more than spoken permission from a secret panel of judges? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if the Department of Homeland Security could pull police officers off the street and hold them in cells indefinitely as material witnesses--because they&#39;re working on &quot;sensitive&quot; investigations?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PATRIOT Act and the Homeland Security Act give enormous power to our nation&#39;s top federal law enforcement officials. They operate under the presumption that these officials are honest, diligent, and fair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if they&#39;re not?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In THE COLD HIT, Detective Shane Scully suspects that the regional boss of the Department of Homeland Security is thwarting a major murder investigation. But why? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Allen Virtue can act without oversight or accountability. There&#39;s no way to question him; there&#39;s no way to way to check up on him; there&#39;s no way to find out if he&#39;s exceeding his authority. Virtually at will, he can bug anyone he considers a threat to national security, take over criminal investigations, and jail cops. Even if he &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; breaking the law, there&#39;s no way to know it. There&#39;s nothing to rely on but his integrity. His professional commitment. His good name. Virtue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may be a very big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shane and his partner are investigating &quot;the Fingertip Killer,&quot; a serial murderer preying on homeless Vietnam vets in Los Angeles. A bullet taken from one victim&#39;s skull matches the bullet that killed another man ten years earlier--an unexpected ballistics match linking one unsolved case to another that police call a &quot;cold hit.&quot; When the earlier victim turns out to have been an LAPD cop, the investigation becomes very personal for Shane. But there&#39;s a problem: Robert Allen Virtue wants him taken off it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To solve the cop&#39;s murder, and possibly the Fingertip case, Scully must go behind the powerful bureaucrat&#39;s back and deep undercover--where he will begin unraveling a deadly far-reaching conspiracy that threatens to destroy everything he loves: his career, his freedom, and his family.&lt;/p&gt;" />
