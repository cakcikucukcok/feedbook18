  <title>Wolves in Sheep&#39;s Clothing - Robert Thornhill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Walt Williams is a sixty-eight year old rookie cop. When a holistic physician is murdered, Walt becomes entangled in the high-powered world of corporate giants and corrupt politicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The Police Department and the FBI join forces and Walt goes undercover in a &#39;sting&#39; operation in order to expose those involved in this tangled web of intrigue and political corruption, and in doing so, becomes the target of a vicious assassin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Walt is also a &#39;rookie husband&#39; and his new bride, Maggie, is determined to convert him from a life of comfort food and bachelor indulgence to a healthier lifestyle filled with organic food, vitamins, supplements and colon cleanses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;A dead-serious mystery with hilarious twists!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Reader review: &quot;In Wolves In Sheep&#39;s Clothing, you are reading about the crimes that involve Pharmaceutical companies, healthcare professionals, the FDA and the FTC and to what end? Money, power and greed that affects the well being of all of us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Once I opened this book and started reading the first chapter, I could not put it down and wanted to see just how far into the political system this would go. Just how far would a pharmaceutical company go to keep their products on the market? What would happen if a study was released announcing to the world the fact that medicine is being sold and provided to patients unnecessarily without alternative methods being discussed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The reading grabs you from the first murder and you to find yourself hunting for the hawk-faced man along with the detectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The author does a great job with the characters, keeping you involved in the medical mystery and you learn about some alternatives that you could research on your own.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
