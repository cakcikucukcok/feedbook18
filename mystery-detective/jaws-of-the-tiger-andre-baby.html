  <title>Jaws of the Tiger - Andre Baby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A luxury vacation becomes a terrifying ordeal when pirates take over the Miami- bound cruise ship Caravan Star and demand $60 million in their offshore account within four hours. A Navy SEAL rescue operation executed from the USS Anzio is successful, but leaves many passengers dead and dozens injured including Interpol agent Thiery Dulac and his friend Karen Dawson. Taking advantage of Dulac’s firsthand knowledge of the attack after his recuperation, his boss Annette Arlberg assigns him to help the British authorities search for the perpetrators of the meticulously planned hijacking. Dulac is about to unveil an intricate web of dirty money, cover-ups and murders, when Home Secretary Sir Terence Hays invokes British national security interests and pulls Dulac off the case, reinforcing his suspicions that members of the British cabinet may be involved. Now all he has to do is live long enough to prove it." />
