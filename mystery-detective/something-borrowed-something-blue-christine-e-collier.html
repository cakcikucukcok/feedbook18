  <title>Something Borrowed, Something Blue - Christine E. Collier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Amy, a member of the Writer&#39;s Club, is busy helping her daughter, Rachel, plan her wedding. Will it be wedded bliss or more mystery for the Writer&#39;s Club?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the sleepy little town of Foggy Grove the bridal shop, Something Borrowed, Something Blue, is in the home of a wonderful seamstress, Margaret Brown. We learn that years earlier Margaret&#39;s own wedding was halted just as her father was to walk her down the aisle. Why did she never marry the man she loved so much and tenderly nicknamed, her huckleberry friend?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We meet Ivory, the young helper Margaret hires to work in her shop. Ivory dreams of becoming a writer but spends much of her time caring for her sister, Jade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has happened to the bride, Raven Moore? Why did she call off her wedding one week before it was scheduled? Why is her car parked at Foggy Grove Inlet near the Sweetheart Tree and why is her name carved into this tree with a question mark?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;I&gt;Foggy Grove Gazette&lt;/I&gt; will raise questions about Raven&#39;s whereabouts and the crow hunters that have come from all over the country. The popular column, &lt;I&gt;Dear Miss Lonely Heart&lt;/I&gt;, will share two letters that cause a stir in Foggy Grove, as does a rare second edition of the newspaper!&lt;/p&gt;" />
