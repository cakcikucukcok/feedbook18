  <title>If Two of Them Are Dead - Carol Cail</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Co-owner of a small Colorado newspaper, reporter Maxey Burnell is taking a well-deserved vacation - her first in years. While visiting her only relatives, Aunt Janet and Cousin Curtis, she makes a startling discovery. Not only is her father still alive, but Janet saw him leaving the scene of Maxey&#39;s mother&#39;s murder ten years ago. Determined to prove that no father of hers could be a killer, Maxey sets out to clear his name, even though it turns out that he&#39;d rather she didn&#39;t. Aided and abetted by Janet&#39;s live-in codger, Scotty, Maxey gets to know the small town&#39;s residents, including Curtis&#39;s good buddy Lance and Lance&#39;s not-so-great parents; a soft-water salesman who&#39;s hard to like; and a neighbor who wants to help but can&#39;t remember the question, let alone the crime. By the time Maxey learns the truth, she may prove the Ben Franklin adage: Three may keep a secret, if two of them are dead.&lt;/p&gt;" />
