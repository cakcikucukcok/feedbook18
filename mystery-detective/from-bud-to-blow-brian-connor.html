  <title>From Bud to Blow - Brian Connor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;While innocent and na&amp;iuml;ve to peer pressure, Cory Carter is more self-aware than most going off to college. That is, until pledging a fraternity at Indiana University changes his outlook on life. Hazing leads to blood. Blood leads to regret. Regret leads to a transformation, making Cory into the biggest drug dealer on campus. For the first time in his life, he loses self-control. The power of that feeling drives Cory the rest of college, as he slowly descends into a new reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of buying the weekly weed he smokes, he decides to sell it himself. Instead of lying to his girlfriend, he decides to break up with her. By the time sophomore year comes around, Cory is buying enough weed to supply every fraternity on campus. Friends of friends start asking for cocaine and molly, but to Cory, if the drugs were on campus anyway, why not be the one selling it? All he has to do is pick up a duffle bag on Tuesday, drop off a few baggies on Wednesday, and count the money on Thursday. He has independence, he has power, he has his control back. That is, until a student overdoses and a detective comes knocking on Cory&amp;rsquo;s door, leaving Cory scrambling for answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He realizes quickly he&amp;rsquo;s not just driving around town dropping off baggies to friends, he&amp;rsquo;s the local drug gang&amp;rsquo;s #1 distributor. And they won&amp;rsquo;t let him quit. While his friends prep for their biggest party weekend of the year, Cory&amp;rsquo;s looking down the barrel of a gun with a decision to make. Does he battle the drug gang for his freedom? Or can he outsmart the police and keep dealing?&lt;/p&gt;" />
