  <title>Genetic Swaps an Ethical Dilemma - Nickolas Bay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story involves the illegal and legal swapping of one persons gene for implanting into another person to change their intelligence.  Although this book is fictional, it points out the ways science could change our political and ethical values.
This book begins with a goal to help disabled children through new discoveries and gene manipulations by swapping genes.. The main character, Dr. Janet Stewart, directs a secret CIA lab whose basic purpose is to discover how certain genes operate. Her discovery of the gene that controls a persons IQ is secretly tested in childrens clinics, military academies, prisons and finally in terrorist interrogations at Guantanamo Bay. Genetic swaps are  performed with dramatic results.
Dr. Stewarts associations with two neurosurgeons, who are also interested in genetic research, bring about the discovery of the C mystery gene.  An amazing observation is made after testing humans at a secret lab in Pahrump, Nevada.  This gene proves to be fundamental in a persons thought regarding faith and trust.  This leads to tests with Atheists, Agnostics, Catholics and Muslims.  Tests show how a suicide bomber constantly reinforces his faith gene, through free will, to enable him to destroy his own life and that of others.
Finally, The President of the United States directs Dr. Stewart to devise a program to be used on all foreign students visiting the United States that would make them our secret ambassadors without them ever knowing it.  This is not a far fetched idea.  New gene discoveries are being made as you read this novel..
The purpose of this book is to give a simple warning.  As a world leader the United States must be vigilant not to exchange human control for human rights.  This new knowledge is dangerous in the wrong hands.." />
