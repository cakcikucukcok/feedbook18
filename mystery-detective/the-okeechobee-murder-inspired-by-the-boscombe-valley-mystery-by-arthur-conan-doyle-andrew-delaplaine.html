  <title>The Okeechobee Murder - Inspired by “The Boscombe Valley Mystery” by Arthur Conan Doyle - Andrew Delaplaine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In “The Okeechobee Murder,” inspired by Conan Doyle’s “The Boscombe Valley Mystery,” Holmes and Watson are called to a remote area of Florida overlooking Lake Okeechobee to investigate a murder where all the evidence points to the victim&#39;s son as the killer. Holmes, however, is not so sure.  
Sherlock Holmes IV is a direct descendant of the famed detective whose daring exploits were so vividly chronicled by Dr. John Watson and related to us by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. 
This new Sherlock Holmes owns a small hotel (The Fleming House named after Ian Fleming of James Bond fame) on Miami’s South Beach, and this Sherlock is just as renowned in the present day as his illustrious ancestor was in his. 
“Imagine Sherlock Holmes—or rather, his great-great-great-grandson—living on South Beach and solving crimes and mysteries with the same aplomb as his famous forebear and you’ll get the picture of what’s going on here…”
   --Bartholomew Fox, author of “Deadlock”
“Witty and clever, with a whole new cast of characters to support this new Holmes and this new Watson. They live in a small boutique hotel on Lincoln Road called Fleming House (named after Sherlock the IV&#39;s love for James Bond author Ian Fleming). Holmes paces about in the penthouse while Watson (yes, he&#39;s a direct descendant of Dr. Watson) manages Fleming House. The cast of supporting characters, from the unseen brilliant but tempestuous Chef Hilario to the colorful Bjorn Karlsen, the gay manager of the Crown Colony restaurant in the hotel who has to put up with the irascible Cuban chef, are refreshing and contemporary.”
                 --Renee Rodgers, author of “A Tuned Body”
“There have been countless mutations of the iconic Holmes over the last century, but none has this contemporary approach using not merely a reworked manifestation of the original character, but a descendant of the first Holmes.”
--- Nathaniel Pembroke, author of  “A James Joyce Chronicle”
“You’ll like not only this new Sherlock Holmes, but the hip new world he finds himself living in… South Beach. Lady Gaga even makes an appearance in ‘The Red-haired Man’!”
