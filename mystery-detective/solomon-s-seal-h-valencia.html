  <title>Solomon’S Seal - H. Valencia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To escape the troubles of their big city lives, Gisele and Beniah Panganiban decide  as many had before them  to seek refuge in the wilderness. Against the woman he often referred to as his wifes wishes, Beniah leases an enigmatic log house; that is situated deep in the forests of Manitoba, Canada. For two years, the couple wrestles with angels that seem to be as personal as they are professional. Then, in the middle of the night, they hear a knock on the big, red door. Handcuffed together, they hobble down the sixteen stairs. In the unforgiving winter, a stranger calls out. Ayuda me. My husband has been badly injured.... Por favor, I know youre in there. What follows is a fantastic journey that includes  but is no way limited to  gunplay, noble fables, pig genitalia, a fair amount of corruption, encieros, a love triangle, Samurai bonds, and of course Chim-Chim the Great Grey Owl. Some of them will learn what theyre good at, what theyre horrible at, what theyre psychotic about. And, at least, one of them is going to be buried out there. So, make yourself at home, mind the carpets, no cigars, and Welcome to Solomons Seal." />
