  <title>Return of the Thin Man: Two never-before-published novellas featuring Nick &amp; Nora Charles - Dashiell Hammett, Richard Layman, Julie M. Rivett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Dashiell Hammett was a crime writer who elevated the genre to true literature, and The Thin Man was Hammett&#39;s last--and most successful--novel. Following the enormous success of &quot;The Thin Man&quot; movie in 1934, Hammett was commissioned to write stories for additional films. He wrote two full-length novellas, for the films that became &quot;After the Thin Man&quot; and &quot;Another Thin Man&quot;. Bringing back his classic characters, retired private investigator Nick Charles and his former debutante wife Nora, who return home to find Nora&amp;#8217;s family gardener murdered, pulling the couple back into another deadly game of cat and mouse. Hammett has written two fully satisfying &quot;Thin Man&quot; stories, with classic, barbed Hammett dialogue and fully developed characters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Neither of these stories has been previously published (except for a partial in a small magazine 25 years ago). The Return of the Thin Man is a hugely entertaining read that brings back two classic characters from one of the greatest of mystery writers who ever lived. This book is destined to become essential reading for Hammett&#39;s millions of fans and a new generation of mystery readers the world over.&lt;/div&gt;" />
