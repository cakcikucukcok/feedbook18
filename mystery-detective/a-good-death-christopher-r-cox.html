  <title>A Good Death - Christopher R. Cox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A first rate mystery, beautifully crafted, fast-paced, and populated with the most vivid (and at times seamy) characters... A bravura debut!&quot; --Douglas Preston, #1 bestselling co-author of the Pendergast series of novels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nail-biting debut mystery that plunges readers into the seamy side streets of late-90s Bangkok and across the untamed mountains of  the Lao-Vietnam border, hot on the heels of an alluring woman who&#39;s officially dead - unless she&#39;s masterminded a half-million-dollar life-insurance scam&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An expertly crafted debut, A GOOD DEATH introduces Sebastian Damon, a sharp-witted though struggling Boston PI who catches an intriguing case.  Linda Watts is a beautiful, talented Southeast Asian refugee  with a promising career in  finance--or she was, until she turned up dead, the victim of a heroin OD, in a cheap Bangkok guest house.  Her death seemed straightforward to the Thai authorities, but her insurance company isn&#39;t buying it.  They send Sebastian  halfway around the world to investigate--where he finds himself confounded and completely out of place chasing faint leads through the broken, bewildering streets of Thailand&#39;s teeming capital.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An award-winning journalist with decades of experience traveling in and reporting on Southeast Asia, Christopher R. Cox takes readers on a vibrant journey through a corrupt  police bureaucracy, a network of steamy Bangkok nightclubs and grimy hostels to a place where you can you feel the humid air and smell the stir-fried street food.  Along the way, Sebastian finds romance as he falls for a  captivatingly mysterious woman and camaraderie with his father&#39;s wise-cracking old Special Forces wingman -- an expat  who can navigate Bangkok&#39;s chaotic underbelly and the wild mountains of Laos with equal aplomb.  For Sebastian, it&#39;s the assignment of a lifetime, a chase that will lead him to a long-buried truth at the heart of all the dark lies, a quest that will change him forever in this richly imagined, compelling debut perfect for fans of John Burdett.&lt;/p&gt;" />
