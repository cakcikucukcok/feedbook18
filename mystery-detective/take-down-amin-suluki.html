  <title>Take Down - Amin Suluki</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Some may say that the Italian Mafia no longer exists or that they do but lost their power and influence since the take down of the Dapper Don, John Gotti. But if you were to ask Jahmeel, a New Yorker from the heart of New York City, or Billy Joe, a half-Italian country boy from the backwoods of Alabama, they will tell you that those statements are far from the truth. In fact, they would tell you that not only does the Mafia still exists, but they also are more powerful now than ever before. So will Jahmeel and Billy Joe, both of whom suffered tremendously at the hands of the Mafia and who experienced a clash of cultures upon meeting each other, be able to hash out their differences to take down this common enemy? Or is it an impossible task? Join in as millions of readers pry into the mind of Amin Suluki, author of Right Back at You, to unveil the existence of an Italian crime family still operating in America today." />
