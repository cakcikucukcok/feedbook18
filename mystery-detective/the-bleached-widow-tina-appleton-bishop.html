  <title>The Bleached Widow - Tina Appleton Bishop</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The backdrop for Tina Bishops fifth novel, &lt;i&gt;The Bleached Widow&lt;/i&gt;, is a fashionable resort hotel in Maine. Hotel management, suspecting that Marjorie Truesdell, a glamorous and wealthy widow, is cheating other guests at high stakes bridge, brings in Lowell Rankin, a special detective from Las Vegas, to unmask her and her young accomplice. But when hotel guests start turning up dead, Rankin joins in the hunt for the murderer, a search that takes him up and down the East Coast and back in time. The cast of characters is as colorful as the Maine landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Bleached Widow&lt;/i&gt; is a lively tale of jealousy and intrigue. Suspected murderers abound, as many were envious of the heroine, Marjorie Truesdell, who dominates the story long after her death. Tina Bishop keeps her reader eagerly turning the page, for the victims past is as much of a mystery as the question of who did her in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Judy Richter, Author of &lt;i&gt;It Begins, It Ends&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&#39;t have to love resorts, mysterious characters and golf to enjoy this novel, but if you do, it will only increase your pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
