  <title>Hidden Moon - James Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;A Corpse in the Koryo, &lt;/i&gt;James Church introduced readers to one of the most unique detectives to appear on page in years--the elusive Inspector O. The stunning mystery was named one of the best mystery/thrillers of 2006 by the&lt;i&gt; Chicago Tribune &lt;/i&gt;for its beautifully spare prose and layered descriptions of a terrain Church knows by heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now the Inspector is back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Hidden Moon&lt;/i&gt;, Inspector O returns from a mission abroad to find his new police commander waiting at his office door. There has been a bank robbery--the first ever in Pyongyang--and the commander demands action, and quickly. But is this urgency for real?  Somewhere, someone in the North Korean leadership doesn&#39;t want Inspector O to complete his investigation. And why not? What if the robbery leads to the highest levels of the regime? What if power, not a need for cash, is the real reason behind the heist at the Gold Star Bank?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given a choice, this isn&#39;t a trail a detective in the Pyongyang police would want to follow all the way to the end, even a trail marked with monogrammed silk stockings. &quot;I&#39;m not sure I know where the bank is,&quot; is O&#39;s laconic observation as the warning bells go off in his head. A Scottish policeman sent to provide security for a visiting British official, a sultry Kazakh bank manager, and a mournful fellow detective all combine to put O in the middle of a spiderweb of conspiracies that becomes more tangled, and dangerous, the more he pulls on the threads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, as he did in &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Corpse in the Koryo,&lt;/i&gt; James Church opens a window onto a society where nothing is quite as it seems. The story serves as the reader&#39;s flashlight, illuminating a place that outsiders imagine is always dark and too far away to know. Church&#39;s descriptions of the country and its people are spare and starkly beautiful; the dialogue is lean, every thought weighed and measured before it is spoken. Not a word is wasted, because in this place no one can afford to be misunderstood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critical Acclaim for &lt;i&gt;A Corpse in the Koryo&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;A Corpse in the Koryo &lt;/i&gt; is a crackling good mystery novel, filled with unusual characters involved in a complex plot that keeps you guessing to the end.&quot;&lt;br&gt;--Glenn Kessler, &lt;i&gt;The &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Washington&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; Post&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The best unclassified account of how North Korea works and why it has survived . . . This novel should be required bedtime reading for President Bush and his national security team.&quot; &lt;br&gt;--Peter Hayes, executive director of the Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainable Development&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A new offering that reminds you of why you started reading mysteries and thrillers in the first place.&quot;&lt;br&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Chicago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; Tribune&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What&#39;s perhaps most remarkable---and appealing---about &lt;i&gt;A Corpse in the Koryo &lt;/i&gt;is the tremendously clever complexity (and deceptions) of the plot. The reader is left to marvel at the author&#39;s ability to keep his readers on their intellectual toes for almost three hundred pages. We can only hope that Church has many more novels up his sleeve.&quot;&lt;br&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Tampa&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; Tribune&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;An impressive debut that calls to mind such mystery thrillers as Martin Cruz Smith&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Gorky&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Par&lt;/i&gt;k.&quot; &lt;br&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt; (starred review)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In Inspector O, the author has crafted a complex character with rough charm to spare, and in eternally static North Korea, he has a setting that will fascinate readers for sequels to come.&quot;&lt;br&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt; magazine (Asia edition)&lt;/p&gt;" />
