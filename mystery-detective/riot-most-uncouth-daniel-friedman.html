  <title>Riot Most Uncouth - Daniel Friedman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;1807, Cambridge, England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A young woman is murdered in a boarding house, and nobody knows what to do about it.  The volunteer watchman who patrols the streets of this placid college town has no idea how to investigate a serious crime and the private bounty hunters the girl&#39;s family has hired to catch the killer employ methods that are questionable, at best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Cambridge needs is a hero, and, in a situation such as this, it&#39;s very easy for a gentleman with a romantic disposition to mistake himself for one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;19 year-old Lord Byron, the outlaw poet, is a student at Trinity College, though he can only be described as a &quot;student&quot; in the loosest sense of the word: He rarely attends class and, instead, spends his time day-drinking, making love to faculty wives, and feeding fine cuisine and expensive wine to the bear he keeps as a pet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catching a killer seems like a fine diversion, however, and Byron decides that solving the crime must take precedence over other, less-urgent matters such as his failing grades and mounting debts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written by the Edgar Award-nominated author of &lt;i&gt;Don&#39;t Ever Get Old&lt;/i&gt;, which Publishers Weekly called &quot;wickedly funny,&quot; and inspired by Byron&#39;s moody, sexy and often hilarious poems and letters, this dark, twisty mystery will keep you guessing until its violent conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;" />
