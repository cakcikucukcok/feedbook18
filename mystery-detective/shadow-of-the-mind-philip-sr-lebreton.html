  <title>Shadow of the Mind - Philip Sr. LeBreton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sandy is a young beautiful girl. She could have any man she wanted. Finally, Sandy thinks she&#39;s found the right man. He&#39;s not really that good looking, but he&#39;s rich and comes from a mother of a very wealthy family. Things go terribly wrong. She had a nice little dinner and had a drink in her hand when there was a knock at the back door. Her boyfriend, William, goes to answer the door. Sandy thought she heard them arguing, and then William stumbled into his living room with blood gushing from his chest. He fell dead on the floor. The two men grabbed little Sandy, and she fights hard to get away, but they are too strong.
A police detective who specializes in murder cases just moved to Maine. Chief of police is an old friend of Ned&#39;s, and he asks him if he would take over the murder case. 
Ned agrees to find the murderers." />
