  <title>The Pericles Commission - Gary Corby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nicolaos walks the mean streets of Classical Athens as an agent for the promising young politician Pericles. His mission is to find the assassin of the statesman Ephialtes, the man who brought democracy to Athens and whose murder has thrown the city into uproar. It&#39;s a job not made any easier by the depressingly increasing number of dead witnesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But murder and mayhem don&#39;t bother Nico; what&#39;s really on his mind is how to get closer (much closer) to Diotima, the intelligent and annoyingly virgin priestess of Artemis, and how to shake off his irritating twelve year-old brother Socrates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Pericles Commission &lt;/i&gt;is the first in an exciting new series by first-time novelist Gary Corby, who takes us to Ancient Greece at one of the most exciting times in history. In this wonderfully approachable, historically rich novel, Athens is brought vividly to life in a mystery engaging from the first page to last.&lt;/p&gt;" />
