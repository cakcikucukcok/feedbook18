  <title>The Third Victim - Phillip Margolin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Margolin continues his return to the exceptional form of his early novels with this gripping, tightly plotted, and smoothly written legal thriller... A winner from a veteran genre author.&quot;  --&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The &quot;master of heart-pounding suspense&quot; returns with a brand new series and a USA Today bestseller &lt;/i&gt;The Third Victim&lt;i&gt; is &lt;/i&gt;New York Times&lt;i&gt; bestseller Phillip Margolin at his very best.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A woman stumbles onto a dark road in rural Oregon--tortured, battered, and bound. She tells a horrific story about being kidnapped, then tortured, until she finally managed to escape. She was the lucky one--two other women, with similar burns and bruises, were found dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The surviving victim identifies the house where she was held captive and the owner, Alex Mason--a prominent local attorney--is arrested. Although he loudly insists upon his innocence, his wife&#39;s statements about his sexual sadism and the physical evidence found at the scene, his summer home, is damning. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Regina Barrister is a legendary criminal defense attorney, known as &quot;The Sorceress&quot; for her courtroom victories. But she&#39;s got a secret, one that threatens her skill, her reputation, and, most of all, her clients. And she&#39;s agreed to take on the seemingly impossible task of defending Alex Mason.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Robin Lockwood, a young lawyer and former MMA fighter, has just left a clerkship at the Oregon Supreme Court to work for Regina Barrister. The Alex Mason trial is her first big one, a likely death penalty case, and she&#39;s second chair to Regina. Increasingly, she&#39;s worried her boss&#39;s behavior and the details in the case against their client don&#39;t quite add up.&lt;/p&gt;" />
