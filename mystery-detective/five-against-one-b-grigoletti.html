Five against One
	Theyre back Caitlin and Nicole OConner return in the second installment of The Soul Patrol series.  Almost a year has passed since the girls and their friends uncovered the twisted secret that kept their dead friend Kelsey trapped here in this world.  In that time, the family has been re-united now that their dad has moved back in.  But all is not well for our heroines. Caitlin is finding life lonely and complicated since her best friends death.  To make matters worse, the perky and seemingly perfect Savannah Summers has just moved into the neighborhood, turning things upside for the entire OConnor clan.
	Caitlin tries to be nice but her efforts to befriend this new girl turn sour in one unfortunate misunderstanding after another.  The rivalry between the two girls soon turns bitter when Caitlin is replaced by Savannah as the lead in her school play due to an untimely case of Strep throat.  Organizing her friends with nothing but vengeance on her mind, Caitlin convinces the other girls to begin a smear campaign against the Prima Donnas pristine reputation.  Tensions mount when one of the girls finally decides that the only way to teach Savannah a lesson, is through violence.  
	Will the combined voices of her family and The Soul Patrol convince Caitlin to turn against her friends and warn her bitter enemy about the attack before its too late?" />
