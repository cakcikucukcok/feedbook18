  <title>Question Everything - John Andes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the spring before the presidential election, David Drummer, Senior Analyst in Charge of Interagency Communications in the FBI&amp;rsquo;s Kansas City office, is planning his upcoming retirement to Eleuthera with his lover, Rachel. Instead of enjoying his last few months at the Bureau, he comes face-to-face with a scandal of far-reaching consequences within the Bureau, two apparently unrelated police killings three thousand miles apart, and grassroots rallies designed to rile the voting populace against a foreign force.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In an effort to influence the outcome of the scandal&amp;rsquo;s investigation, David decides to play puppeteer to a newspaper reporter. Simultaneously, he digs into a negative political force from the past that may have some bearing on the investigation of the rallies. His team focuses on learning who the driving force behind the rallies is, and why they have a hint of evil. The Bureau&amp;rsquo;s manipulative efforts to bury the scandal, as well as the facts uncovered about the conspiracy-driven rallies, cause David&amp;rsquo;s emotional and physical well-being to spiral inexorably out of control.&lt;/p&gt;" />
