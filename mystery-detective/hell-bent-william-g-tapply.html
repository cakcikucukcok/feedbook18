  <title>Hell Bent - William G. Tapply</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Boston attorney Brady Coyne finds his own past coming back to haunt his professional life when his ex-girlfriend Alex Shaw, long out of touch, reappears, wanting Brady to represent her brother. Augustine Shaw was a notable photo-journalist, happily married with two small children - until he returned from a stint in Iraq missing a hand and suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Now he&#39;s lost his career, his peace of mind and his family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brady is hired to seem him through the divorce. The client wasn&#39;t eager to accept Brady&#39;s representation, but before the divorce proceedings are very far along, the photographer is found dead in his rented apartment, an apparent suicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But something isn&#39;t right and Brady starts to think the suicide was staged. With very little to go on and with everyone around him wanting to quickly close the books on what appears to be a tragic case, Brady soon finds himself alone, in the midst of one of the most dangerous situations of his entire life, and facing people who do anything  to avoid being exposed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
