  <title>The Associate - Phillip Margolin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; A mesmerizing tale of deceit and criminal stealth in the high-stakes world of pharmaceutical research from Phillip Margolin, the New York Times bestselling master of the courtroom thriller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel Ames is living the American dream. Though born into poverty and living on the streets by the age of fifteen, Daniel has overcome every obstacle -- and now is an associate at Reed, Briggs, Portland&#39;s most prestigious law firm, earning more money than he ever imagined possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Aaron Flynn enters his life, Daniel finds himself caught between his towering ambition and his bedrock idealism. Flynn, a charismatic civil litigator, sues Geller Pharmaceuticals -- Reed, Briggs&#39;s biggest client -- for manufacturing a drug that he claims causes unspeakable birth defects. Daniel is certain the claim has no merit -- until a memo written by a Geller scientist is found, detailing the shocking results of a study that implicates the company in a horrific lie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could Daniel unwittingly be helping Geller cover up a dark secret? As he begins to investigate, his world comes tumbling down around him.  His work is sabotaged, he&#39;s accused of professional incompetence, and he&#39;s fired. Twelve hours later the man who fired him is murdered. Daniel is arrested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With help from two women, including lawyer Amanda Jaffe (whom we met in &lt;em&gt;Wild Justice&lt;/em&gt;), Daniel scrambles to clear his name and save his reputation -- and in the process unearths a trail of deceit that leads back to a series of unsolved kidnappings seven years earlier. But someone doesn&#39;t want this trail explored, and Daniel becomes the target of a vicious killer who will stop at nothing to prevent the truth from being revealed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
