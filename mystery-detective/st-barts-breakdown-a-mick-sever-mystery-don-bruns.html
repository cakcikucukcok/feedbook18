  <title>St. Barts Breakdown: A Mick Sever Mystery - Don Bruns</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rock and roll journalist Mick Sever is back with a new assignment: interview music legend Danny Murtz. Murtz&#39;s walls are lined with platinum records, but his closet is full of skeletons. Known for producing an unbelievable string of hits, Murtz is also tied to a string of disappearances. Seems a number of Murtz&#39;s romantic conquests have vanished into thin air. After his latest incident, Murtz conveniently retreats to his secluded St. Bart villa. Before Mick can hop a plane to the island, he&#39;s nearly run down by a speeding car. Coincidence? Maybe, but hitmaker Danny Murtz and near misses go hand in hand. After receiving anonymous threats, Murtz is convinced: someone wants to bring him down. Even his longtime secretary Nancy, and attorney/manager/cleaner-upper Harvey Schwartz are suspect. And that meddlesome Mick Sever is digging too deep. If Danny Murtz has his way, Mick will only need a one-way ticket to paradise. Because if Mick isn&#39;t careful, his next column will be an obituary - his obituary. Sun, sand and a psychopath: it&#39;s a deadly mix." />
