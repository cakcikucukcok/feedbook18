  <title>Engravings - R. W. Seib</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A supernatural love story and mystery of conspiracy, romance, love, incest, deception, and death.  Some loves never die.&lt;P&gt;
Struggling photographer Nicholas Gibbs feels the goals and dreams of his youth slipping away as he tries to make ends meet in the slowly dying Southern Illinois community of Edmund.  But all that is about to change.  A chance meeting with an old friend, coupled with the death of Beth Jennings, an elderly spinster, and whispered stories of her past starts Nick on the quest of his life.  &lt;P&gt;
Rekindling a relationship with Stacy Cooper, Nick finds himself reluctantly drawn into her crusade to preserve a closed historical engraving school.   Nick soon begins to discover more than he bargained for.  How long suppressed memories of a fateful night from his youth seem to be intertwined with the old schools lurid history.&lt;P&gt;
Nick learns how much Beths bewitching life and her scandalous romance with a worldly stranger form the Far East touched the lives of so many others.  How that affair effected the school and rocked the Victorian values of their town.&lt;P&gt;
Eventually Nick finds himself consumed in a mystery that will forever alter the lives of him and those around him.  His obsession with that mystery becomes a quest, not only for answers concerning the schools past, but also the truth about his own haunted youth.  In the end finding those answers will lay bare an affair that spanned three generations, to 1917 when Victorian pride and bigotry outweighed love and compassion.  &lt;P&gt;
In a tale of passion, discrimination, incest, betrayal, and death that lays bare the hypocrisy of a forgotten era, Nick finally uncovers the truth.  But discovering that truth doesnt come without a price.  That price could be his life as he risks everything to unmask it all to learn the answers of his obsession and the woman of his dreams.  &lt;P&gt;" />
