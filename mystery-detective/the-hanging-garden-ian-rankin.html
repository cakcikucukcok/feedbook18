  <title>The Hanging Garden - Ian Rankin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Hanging Gardens of Babylon... The hanging of four French villagers in World War II... The hanging of an old man in a Scottish cemetery... Seemingly random facts linked to one man... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detective Inspector John Rebus is buried under a pile of paperwork generated by his investigations into a suspected war criminal, and his immediate supervisors are more than happy to have him tucked away in a quiet backwater for several months. However, the escalating dispute between upstart Tommy Telford and Big Ger Cafferty&#39;s gang soon gives Rebus an escape clause. Telford is known to have close ties to a man nicknamed Mr. Pink Eyes, a brutal gangster running a lucrative business bringing Chechen refugees into Britain to work as prostitutes. And when Rebus takes under his wing a distraught Bosnian call girl, it gives him a personal reason to make sure Telford takes the high road out of town. Within days, Rebus&#39;s daughter is the victim of an all-too-professional hit-and-run, and Rebus knows that there&#39;s nothing he won&#39;t do to bring down prime suspect Tommy Telford--even if it means cutting a deal with the devil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A chilling glimpse into the darkest extremes of human cruelty, a page-turning literary thriller, &lt;i&gt;The Hanging Garden&lt;/i&gt;, the ninth entry in Ian Rankin&#39;s award-winning series confirms his reputation as a writer of rare and lasting gifts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
