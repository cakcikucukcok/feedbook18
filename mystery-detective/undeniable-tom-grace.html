  <title>Undeniable - Tom Grace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ex-Navy SEAL Nolan Kilkenny receives a desperate plea for help from doctors frantic to save the life of a young boy with a deadly genetic disorder. The boy, who came to his parents through a blind adoption, has no known blood relatives. Nolan agrees to help, but as he is being prepped for surgery, the boy dies. Further genetic testing then reveals an astonishing truth: Nolan and the boy share the same biological father.&amp;nbsp; Nolan must confront his own father to find out the truth behind the discovery, and uncovers a heinous blackmail plot and desperate victims and villains.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;Undeniable&lt;/em&gt;, the sixth Nolan Kilkenny thriller from international bestselling author Tom Grace, takes Nolan into the brave new world of reproductive technology, where the building blocks of life are manipulated in a Petri dish, women lease their wombs like rental properties, and money trumps morality.&amp;nbsp; In an age of rapid advances in human genetics, cloning and stem cell research, what seemed impossible just a few years ago is now a reality. DNA has been reduced from a miraculous molecule into a data storage device, and the information it contains is as easy to hack as any computer file. &lt;em&gt;Undeniable&lt;/em&gt; is a novel that steps beyond the traditional parent-child relationship into a chilling new reproductive reality." />
