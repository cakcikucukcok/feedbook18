  <title>The Poor Boy&#39;s Game - Dennis Tafoya</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When US Marshal Frannie Mullen gets one of her best friends shot during a routine apprehension, her career is over. Still reeling from the loss, Frannie is trying to sort out her feelings for Wyatt, the reformed outlaw who loves her, and to support her newly-sober sister, Mae, as she struggles with the fallout of their unstable, violent childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their father Patrick Mullen is a thug, a vicious enforcer for a corrupt Philadelphia union, and when he escapes from prison, bodies of ex-rivals and witnesses begin piling up. Now Frannie is suspected as an accomplice in his escape and targeted by shadowy killers from the Philadelphia underworld. Unsure who to trust, drawing on the skills she&#39;s learned as a Marshal and her training as a boxer, Frannie is forced to fight to protect her shattered sister and Patrick&#39;s pregnant girlfriend from the most dangerous criminal she&#39;s ever faced--her own father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Poor Boy&#39;s Game&lt;/i&gt; is the most propulsive, riveting novel yet from crime fiction master Dennis Tafoya.&lt;/p&gt;" />
