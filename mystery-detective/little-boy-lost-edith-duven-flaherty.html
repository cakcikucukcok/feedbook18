  <title>Little Boy Lost - Edith Duven Flaherty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Book Description for Web Page
	Corey Wheelock, her best friend Chris, and her adopted two year old son Danny are enjoying a lakeside camping weekend when Danny is kidnapped.  Tense days of searching follow; when no ransom note arrives, Corey tries not to fear the unthinkable.  But when a handsome private investigator comes to her home with questions about the Christmas night a new-born baby appeared on her doorstep, a new fear is added.  Danny is alive and well, but an unknown someone has received a ransom demand for his grandson.
	Earl and Yolanda, dangerously incompetent criminals, are not becoming rich and happy as easily as they had hoped.  They blunder, they get both careless and unlucky, and almost inevitably their kidnap venture leads to two deaths.  A fortune teller/psychic and her slightly retarded brother accidentally become a factor in Dannys safety, and Tommy Logan, the private investigator, suddenly finds his work has become far more exciting than his usual dull routine chores." />
