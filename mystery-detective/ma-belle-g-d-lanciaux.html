Isabelle Roberts and her friend, Rachel Burns, two American actresses, end up in a small tourist town in Canada to rest and regain their strength from an over-charged work schedule. By accident, they meet up with a handsome Canadian by the name of Jason Young. Against Rachels judgement, Isabelle falls in love with Jason, who has recently overcome a tragic event.
Jason Young is a reserved man that talks little of his past, except for the mention of the loss of his wife and kids in a car accident in which the cause was never determined. Charmingit didnt take long for Isabelle Roberts to fall in love with him. Rachel Burns had a certain mistrust towards him but envied Isabelles new love adventure. After two weeks, Rachel is called back to work. Isabelle stays behind with her new love for the rest of her vacation and promises to call Rachel everyday to reassure her that everything is fine. One day, Rachel loses contact with her. Her imagination gets the better of her. Where is she and what happened?
