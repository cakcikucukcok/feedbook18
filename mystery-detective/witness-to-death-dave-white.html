  <title>Witness To Death - Dave White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The phenomenal ebook bestseller from the acclaimed author of the Jackson Donne series!&lt;br&gt;Named one of the Best Crime Novels of the Year by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinal&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;John Brighton is an ordinary young schoolteacher still hung up on his ex, Michelle. Suspecting her new boyfriend is cheating on her, John decides to follow Frank&#39;s Lexus and find out the truth once and for all. Turns out John&#39;s in for a major surprise. Frank isn&#39;t heading for some sack time with another girl. Instead he drags John into the middle of a shootout on the banks of the Hudson River, and before John knows what&#39;s happening, he&#39;s knee-deep in bodies.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Before the corpses can even cool, Frank disappears and John finds himself wanted for five murders. With no way to prove his innocence, John goes on the run&amp;#151;not only from the police, but a vicious assassin as well. And when Michelle is kidnapped, John&amp;#8217;s worst-case scenario comes true. Though his head tells him to stay in hiding, his heart says otherwise. He has to save the woman he loves or die trying.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As John begins to uncover the truth surrounding the events that have turned his life upside down, he learns it isn&amp;#8217;t just Michelle he must rescue. Thousands of other innocent lives are in jeopardy too.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A heart-pounding, heart-stopping, heart-breaking thriller from two-time Shamus Award nominated author, Dave White. For fans of Harlan Coben, Thomas Perry and Jeff Abbott.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Praise for Witness to Death&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Dave White has always been able to build stories with the right balance of suspense and contemplative character study. He builds a character that is like us. Regular, normal. A guy with real fears.&quot; --The Hungry Detective&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;A terrific thriller.&quot; --The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel&lt;/div&gt;" />
