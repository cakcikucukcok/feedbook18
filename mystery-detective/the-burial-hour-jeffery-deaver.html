  <title>The Burial Hour - Jeffery Deaver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Forensic detective Lincoln Rhyme is back with his most harrowing case yet in this newest installment of Jeffrey Deaver&#39;s &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A businessman snatched from an Upper East Side street in broad daylight. A miniature hangman&#39;s noose left at the scene. A nine-year-old girl, the only witness to the crime. With a crime scene this puzzling, forensic expertise of the highest order is absolutely essential. Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs are called in to investigate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Soon the case takes a stranger turn: a recording surfaces of the victim being slowly hanged, his desperate gasps the backdrop to an eerie piece of music. The video is marked as the work of The Composer...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Despite their best efforts, the suspect gets away. So when a similar kidnapping occurs on a dusty road outside Naples, Italy, Rhyme and Sachs don&#39;t hesitate to rejoin the hunt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  But the search is now a complex case of international cooperation--and not all those involved may be who they seem. Sachs and Rhyme find themselves playing a dangerous game, with lives all across the globe hanging in the balance." />
