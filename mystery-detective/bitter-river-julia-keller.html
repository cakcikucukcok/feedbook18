  <title>Bitter River - Julia Keller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the next stunning novel from Pulitzer Prize-winning Julia Keller, following the popular &lt;i&gt;A Killing in the Hills&lt;/i&gt;, a pregnant teenager is found murdered at the bottom of a river.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phone calls before dawn are never good news. And when you&#39;re the county&#39;s prosecuting attorney, calls from the sheriff are rarely good news, either. So when Bell Elkins picks up the phone she already knows she won&#39;t like what she&#39;s about to hear, but she&#39;s still not prepared for this: 16-year-old Lucinda Trimble&#39;s body has been found at the bottom of Bitter River. And Lucinda didn&#39;t drown--she was dead before her body ever hit the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a case like that, Bell knows the coming weeks are going to be tough. But that&#39;s not all Bell is coping with these days. Her daughter is now living with Bell&#39;s ex-husband, hours away. Sheriff Nick Fogelsong, one of Bell&#39;s closest friends, is behaving oddly. Furthermore, a face from her past has resurfaced for reasons Bell can&#39;t quite figure. Searching for the truth, both behind Lucinda&#39;s murder and behind her own complicated relationships, will lead Bell down a path that might put her very life at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Bitter River&lt;/i&gt;, Pulitzer Prize-winner Julia Keller once again weaves a compelling, haunting mystery against the stark beauty and extreme poverty of a small West Virginia mountain town.&lt;/p&gt;" />
