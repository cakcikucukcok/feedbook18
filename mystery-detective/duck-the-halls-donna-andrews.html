  <title>Duck the Halls - Donna Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&#39;Tis the season to be jolly - and for Meg Langslow to round up stray animals of all sorts as well as a killer.  Duck the Halls!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brilliantly funny Donna Andrews delivers boughs of holly and barrels of laughs with Meg&#39;s latest adventure in her award-winning, New York Times bestselling series. A few nights before Christmas, Meg is awakened when volunteer fireman Michael is summoned to the New Life Baptist Church, where someone has rigged a cage full of skunks in the choir loft. The lengthy process of de-skunking the church requires its annual pre-Christmas concert to relocate to Trinity Episcopal, where Mother insists the show must go on, despite the budget-related protests of Mr. Vess, an elderly vestryman.  Meanwhile, when Meg helps her grandfather take the skunks to the zoo, they discover that his boa has been stolen - only to turn up later during the concert, slithering out from the ribbon-bedecked evergreens.  The next morning is Sunday, and the congregation of St. Byblig&#39;s, the local Catholic church, arrive to find it completely filled with several hundred ducks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s clear that some serious holiday pranksters are on the loose, and Meg is determined to find them.  But before she can, a fire breaks out at Trinity, and Mr. Vess is discovered dead. Who would have murdered such a harmless - if slightly cranky - old man?  Who has the time during the busy holiday season to herd all of these animals into the town&#39;s churches?  And will Meg ever be able to finish all of her shopping, wrapping, cooking, caroling, and decorating in time for Christmas Eve? A Yuletide treasure for the ages, Duck the Halls is guaranteed to put the &quot;ho ho hos&quot; into readers&#39; holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now with an excerpt from Donna Andrews&#39; next Meg Langslow holiday mystery&lt;i&gt; How the Finch Stole Christmas!&lt;/i&gt;, available in October 2017.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
