  <title>The Practice Baby - Lm Ardor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;GP Dee Flanary risks her reputation, her livelihood and ultimately her life when she investigates the death of a patient. As Ian Rankin evokes Edinburgh and Jane Harper the Australian bush, this terrifying yet tender thriller immerses us in Sydney and the wild mountains of southern NSW.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tom&amp;#39;s corpse lies cold and decaying on his bed. Can Dee fight the coroner, the police and the medical establishment to prove his death was murder? As she delves into the circumstances around his tragic fate she uncovers a trail of apparently &amp;#39;accidental&amp;#39; deaths and a sinster connection to her own past.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Suspicion and paranoia fight with reason as she tries to uncover the truth. Her discoveries threaten powerful men. The medical board label her psychotic, her deregistration is imminent. If she persists her career and her livelihood will be at risk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the killer attacks Tom&amp;#39;s na&amp;iuml;ve young girlfriend, Dee is forced into an edge-of-your-seat confrontation with a cold and ruthless murderer." />
