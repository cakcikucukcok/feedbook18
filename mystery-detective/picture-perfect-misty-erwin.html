  <title>Picture Perfect - Misty Erwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nothing could make Ashley&#39;s life any better. She is on top of the world with new love. Everything about Kevin Landers is absolutely perfect. He loves all the things she loves, especially her five year old daughter, Katie. Nothing can compare to the feeling she has when she is with him. Ashley doesn&#39;t want to hear her family&#39;s warnings to take it slowly. Why should she miss this chance of a lifetime when he is obviously her soul mate? 
It doesn&#39;t take long for things to subtly change, though. Kevin has a well-concealed temper that scares Ashley when it erupts, yet she is hesitant to address it because she doesn&#39;t want her perfect world to change.  Everything else about him is above repute and he says he only wants her to be happy. If warning bells ring, Ashley doesn&#39;t want to hear them. 
When things take a sudden downhill plunge, Ashley is forced to make a decision. Will she decide to finally see him for what he is or keep loving him with all her heart? True love can&#39;t just be forgotten. Can it?" />
