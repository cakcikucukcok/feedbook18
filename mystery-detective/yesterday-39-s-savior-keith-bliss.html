  <title>Yesterday&#39;s Savior - Keith Bliss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Second Coming is here! Deny it at your peril!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the year 2075 most of the western world has converted to the religion of the Church of the Second Coming. From its humble beginnings, as the figure of Christ began to appear all around the globe, the Church has grown to achieve absolute world power. But rumors surround the Church of the Second Coming, and hint, like so many regimes before it, of deeply held secrets and the use of brutal power to quiet &amp;lsquo;those who oppose.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When David Dyson, a believer and devout priest working for the Church of the Second Coming, is interviewed by a tough female reporter about the outrageous rumors surrounding the Church, Dyson discovers that his whole life may have been built around a lie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will his crisis of faith reveal the Church of the Second Coming&amp;rsquo;s astonishing secrets? You&amp;rsquo;ll be surprised by the revelation and shocked by the misunderstanding of the brutal regime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s Savior is a reminder, particularly relevant in this day and age, that freedom is worth fighting for.&lt;/p&gt;" />
