  <title>Godmother - Mike Toth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;You are experiencing, by reading this book, the only fiction suspense involving true events every published where the writer is actually the acting victim. By assigning the name
Godmother to the woman raising me as her son when mother looked for greener pastures 
with another man away from the coal fields of West Virginia,this book is written. Unless you have the stomach to digest Godmothers 
wrath on Mickey, the boy in this book, I strongly recommend you not read this book. She is mentally unstable and exhibits love and 
compassion to the point of no return during her rage lasting only minutes. Her dependency on sex with his dad while her husband sleeps 
in the room next door, erupts in attempted murder on a cold winter night. Godmothers brutal and abusive manner on the boy, while his dad works in the mine, forces him to use whatever control he can muster to hold her at bay for another  day. His father, uneducated, 
is unable to understand her sudden rage dissipating without reason. He tries to satisfy her desire to brutality by engaging in her 
fulfillmentby showing his anger striking the boy with his leather strap repeatedly whileshe engages in laughter and hand clapping, 
HIT EM AGAIN. Either Mickey goes to the Union Mission or youre out in the cold, she tells his father. Events leaves his father his 
only choice, take the boy to the Mission. The Union Mission was the boysonly salvation away from her brutally and his father beatings. 
But, life isnt peaches and cream. The brutally continues for months until his father suddenly brings him home back to Godmother wihere 
she is unexpectedly confronted with Mickey home.The rage continues for years, until...&lt;/P&gt;" />
