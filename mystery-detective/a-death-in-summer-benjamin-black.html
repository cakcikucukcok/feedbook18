  <title>A Death in Summer - Benjamin Black</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of The &lt;i&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s Best Reads of 2011&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of Dublin&#39;s most powerful men meets a violent end-- and an acknowledged master of crime fiction delivers his most gripping novel yet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a sweltering summer afternoon, newspaper tycoon Richard Jewell--known to his many enemies as Diamond Dick--is discovered with his head blown off by a shotgun blast. But is it suicide or murder? For help with the investigation, Detective Inspector Hackett calls in his old friend Quirke, who has unusual access to Dublin&#39;s elite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jewell&#39;s coolly elegant French wife, Françoise, seems less than shocked by her husband&#39;s death. But Dannie, Jewell&#39;s high-strung sister, is devastated, and Quirke is surprised to learn that in her grief she has turned to an unexpected friend: David Sinclair, Quirke&#39;s ambitious assistant in the pathology lab at the Hospital of the Holy Family. Further, Sinclair has been seeing Quirke&#39;s fractious daughter Phoebe, and an unlikely romance is blossoming between the two. As a record heat wave envelops the city and the secret deals underpinning Diamond Dick&#39;s empire begin to be revealed, Quirke and Hackett find themselves caught up in a dark web of intrigue and violence that threatens to end in disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tightly plotted and gorgeously written, &lt;i&gt;A Death in Summer &lt;/i&gt;proves to the brilliant but sometimes reckless Quirke that in a city where old money and the right bloodlines rule, he is by no means safe from mortal danger.&lt;/p&gt;" />
