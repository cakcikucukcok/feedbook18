  <title>55Th Island - Jon E. Blair</title>
      <meta name="description" content="James Edward Pettigrad thought he had slipped away, away to a hidden place to perfect his new idea. Even one with seemingly total control can fall into unforeseen circumstances.
In a world so far away, a world of forgotten people, impostures, and those wishing to either have what he will find or stop him before he can see his work to its determined end, a struggle of wills ensues.
Those who make it from this hidden, protected world will hold a power so great, one that could ultimately change the modern world. So simple yet unlimited in application.
Once unveiled James Edward Pettigrad knows that he will never again be free. Will he trade his freedom for a secret so powerful that many would stop at nothing to have it, or will the powers that be find a way to make sure he will not have the opportunity to develop it?" />
