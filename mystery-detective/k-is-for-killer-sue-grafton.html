  <title>&quot;K&quot; is for Killer - Sue Grafton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lorna Kepler was beautiful and willful, a loner who couldn&#39;t resist flirting with danger. Maybe that&#39;s what killed her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her death had raised a host of tough questions. The cops suspected homicide, but they could find neither motive nor suspect. Even the means were mysterious: Lorna&#39;s body was so badly decomposed when it was discovered that they couldn&#39;t be certain she hadn&#39;t died of natural causes. In the way of overworked cops everywhere, the case was gradually shifted to the back burner and became another unsolved file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only Lorna&#39;s mother kept it alive, consumed by the certainty that somebody out there had gotten away with murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the ten months since her daughter&#39;s death, Janice Kepler had joined a support group, trying to come to terms with her loss and her anger. It wasn&#39;t helping. And so, leaving a session one evening and noticing a light on in the offices of Millhone Investigations, she knocked on the door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In answering that knock, Kinsey Millhone is pulled into the netherworld of unavenged murder, where only a pact with the devil will satisfy the restless ghosts of the victims and give release to the living they have left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eleven books into the series that has won her readers around the world, Sue Grafton takes a darkside turn, pitching us into a shadow land of pain and grief where killers still walk free, unaccused, unpunished, unrepentant. With &lt;i&gt;&quot;K&quot; is for Killer&lt;/i&gt; she offers a tale that is dark, complex, and deeply disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A&quot; Is for Alibi&lt;br&gt;&quot;B&quot; Is for Burglar&lt;br&gt;&quot;C&quot; Is for Corpse&lt;br&gt;&quot;D&quot; Is for Deadbeat&lt;br&gt;&quot;E&quot; Is for Evidence&lt;br&gt;&quot;F&quot; Is for Fugitive&lt;br&gt;&quot;G&quot; Is for Gumshoe&lt;br&gt;&quot;H&quot; Is for Homicide&lt;br&gt;&quot;I&quot; Is for Innocent&lt;br&gt;&quot;J&quot; Is for Judgment&lt;br&gt;&quot;K&quot; Is for Killer&lt;br&gt;&quot;L&quot; is for Lawless&lt;br&gt;&quot;M&quot; Is for Malice&lt;br&gt;&quot;N&quot; Is for Noose&lt;br&gt;&quot;O&quot; Is for Outlaw&lt;br&gt;&quot;P&quot; Is for Peril &lt;br&gt;&quot;Q&quot; Is for Quarry&lt;br&gt;&quot;R&quot; Is for Ricochet &lt;br&gt;&quot;S&quot; Is for Silence &lt;br&gt;&quot;T&quot; Is for Trespass&lt;br&gt;&quot;U&quot; Is for Undertow &lt;br&gt;&quot;V&quot; Is for Vengeance &lt;br&gt;&quot;W&quot; Is for Wasted &lt;br&gt;&quot;X&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
