  <title>Ascension of Satan - Jemadari Vi-  Bee - Kil Kilele</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On the planet Earth, there is a divine super creature that disapproves the accusations long leveled against him by the majority: God, clergymen, and the unwary manipulated masses. This book names that creature Satan. On this planet, Earth, there is a creature who once was humiliated by mens justice system by being wrongly tried, but at the verdict of the trial, he won the case. This book calls that creature Satan.
On this planet, there are few religiously irrational heathens who side with Satan and decide to embark on an interplanetary trip to go and meet God in his hideout and interrogate him on his breach of happy promises that he flooded men with. This book names the delegation members who accompany Satan on this perilous but brave odyssey.
Once God is met and discussions take place, this book relates how God is cornered against the wall and finds his salvation only in fleeing the scene. This book unfurls an unusual suspense when Satan and his comrades defeat God and his celestial cabinet members and return to Earth to prepare for the Trial of God. At first, what may seem a horror story will turn out to be the most liberating experience that will bring the reader close to the reality. Consequently, it is a mind-shift experience." />
