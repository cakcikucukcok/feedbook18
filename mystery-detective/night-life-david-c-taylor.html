  <title>Night Life - David C. Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;*A 2016 Mystery Writers of America Edgar Award Nominee for Best Novel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;*Winner of the 2016 Nero Wolfe Award for Best American Mystery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David C. Taylor&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Night Life&lt;/i&gt; takes us back to New York City in 1954.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cold War is heating up. Senator Joe McCarthy is running a witch hunt for Communists in America. The newly formed CIA is fighting a turf battle with the FBI to see who will be the primary US intelligence agency. And the bodies of murdered young men are turning up in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Cassidy has an unusual background for a New York cop. His father, a refugee from Eastern Europe, is a successful Broadway producer. His godfather is Frank Costello, a Mafia boss. Cassidy also has an unusual way of going about the business of being a cop-maybe that&#39;s why he threw a fellow officer out a third story window of the Cortland Hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cassidy is assigned to the case of Alexander Ingram, a Broadway chorus dancer found tortured and dead in his apartment in Hell&#39;s Kitchen. Complications grow as other young men are murdered one after the other. And why are the FBI, the CIA, and the Mafia interested in the death of a Broadway gypsy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a mysterious, beautiful woman moves into Cassidy&#39;s building in Greenwich Village. Is Dylan McCue a lover or an enemy? Cassidy is plagued by nightmares-dreams that sometimes become reality. And he has been dreaming that someone is coming to kill him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
