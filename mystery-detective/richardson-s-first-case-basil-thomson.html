  <title>Richardson’s First Case - Basil Thomson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The D.D.I. recognized him and smiled. “That was a great case you brought us. You’ll be interested to hear that it is a case of mur-r-der!”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For eight years Basil Thomson headed the famous C.I.D., New Scotland Yard. He knew the Yard inside out. Now in this tale of mystery and detection we are taken behind the scenes. We are shown the greatest detection machine in the world in motion, and see how the Yard tracked down its man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stand, then, with young P.C. Richardson on the misty corner of Baker Street, while the traffic of the city swings by, and fate lays at his feet the beginning of his career. Out of the fog brakes shriek, a big car jolts to a stop, and from beneath the wheels the crowd disentangles a bundle of old clothes, within which is a man quite dead; a man who had said to someone, “Very well, then; I’ll call a policeman”—and was killed. Work with him to the ingenious solution, when he takes from his pocket the clue holding the fate of a human life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Richardson’s First Case&lt;/i&gt; was originally published in 1933. This new edition, the first in over seventy years, features an introduction by crime novelist Martin Edwards, author of acclaimed genre history &lt;i&gt;The Golden Age of Murder&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The story is a good one, with enough mystery in it to keep the reader wondering.” &lt;i&gt;Daily Telegraph&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
