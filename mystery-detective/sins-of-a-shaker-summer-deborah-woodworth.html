  <title>Sins of a Shaker Summer - Deborah Woodworth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rose Callahan, newly appointed eldress of the community of Believers at the Kentucky Shaker viliage of North Homage, confesses to a nagging resentment toward Andrew, sent by the lead ministry in Mount Lebanon to act as trustee. She knows little about the man, except that he&amp;#39;s taken charge of the Medicinal Herb Garden, over which Rose previously had control, and he&amp;#39;s been expanding the tiny industry and experimenting with new medicinal herbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now two little girls have suddenly become deathly ill, and Rose&amp;#39;s attention turns to the herb garden. Suspecting that the girls may have taken a notion to nibble on pretty but poisonous plants, she fears their hallowed land may have accidentally been turned into a killing ground. But as Rose investigates, mysterious death invades the gentle oasis of their spiritual world, and some chilling secrets come to light...secrets that bring Rose closer to a truth that even a nonviolent Believer might kill to keep.&lt;/p&gt;" />
