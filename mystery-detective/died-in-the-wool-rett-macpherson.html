  <title>Died in the Wool - Rett MacPherson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With the Garden Club&#39;s First Annual Rose Show right around the corner and a historic house up for sale, Torie O&#39;Shea, mother of three and president of the historical society in New Kassel, Missouri, has her hands full. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nosy by nature, Torie can&#39;t help but poke around the old Kendall house, rumored to contain rare Civil War artifacts and even rarer quilts that would make fantastic additions to the historic Gaheimer House that Torie runs. But why stop there when the house itself would make such a wonderful addition to New Kassel&#39;s historical homes? It could even become a textile museum. Sadly, the house&#39;s history is as tragic as it is rich: In the 1920s, three twenty-something siblings committed suicide, and the more Torie uncovers, the more involved she becomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her curiosity draws her into some dark places, but it&#39;s a present-day crime that sends her racing to unravel exactly what happened to those three siblings before anyone turns up dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brilliant patchwork of characters and tightly stitched plots in Rett MacPherson&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Died in the Wool&lt;/i&gt; will delight fans of this terrific series and win over new ones.&lt;/p&gt;" />
