  <title>The Design Is Murder - Jean Harrington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;Book five of Murders by Design&lt;/em&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Interior designer Deva Dunne &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be focusing her attention on buying a new home with Lt. Victor Rossi. But in typical Deva-style, she&amp;#39;s got her mind on everyone else&amp;#39;s abodes. Keeping her busy are her two newest clients, who have a lot in common. They both live on Whiskey Lane, and both were involved with the same woman. Coincidence or competition?&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;James Stahlman believes Stew Hawkins moved into the house across the street to terrorize him after he became engaged to Kay, Stew&amp;#39;s ex-wife. But Stew is over it. He&amp;#39;s remarried&amp;#151;and to someone much younger. When both women are found &amp;#34;accidentally&amp;#34; dead weeks apart, Deva thinks there&amp;#39;s something afoot on Whiskey Lane. Coincidence or murder?&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Deva can&amp;#39;t stay away&amp;#133;as much as her protective fianc&amp;#233; would like her to. And it&amp;#39;s becoming clear that &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; thinks Deva&amp;#39;s seen too much. With the list of suspects growing, and Deva and Rossi that much closer to becoming homeless&amp;#151;really, where &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; they going to live?&amp;#151;she&amp;#39;ll have to sift through the clues herself, or there&amp;#39;ll be no happily ever after.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;71,000 words" />
