  <title>&#39;&#39;Mystery of Collinsworth Manor&#39;&#39; - Victoria Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The author was born and raised in a small West Virginia town among the hills and mountains she so loves. Her family tree, however, has very deeply planted roots in the Carolinas of the South.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Her Great Grandmother lived to be over ninety years old, but never left the small city where she raised her family in Northern North Carolina.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Her Grandmother moved to Western West Virginia in the roaring 20s and settled down in a small town near the Kentucky border, where the author was latter born, and remains to this day.
 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
She has been afforded the opportunity of raising three wonderful children, who all have left the area, other than one son, who remains.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The two female children have provided her with three marvelous grandchildren. One of the Grandaughters has now brought two wonderfull children into the authors life - one is a Great-Grandaughter and the other a Great-Grandson and loves both dearly.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The author lives with her husband of fifty-two years, and looks forward to completing their lifetime together." />
