  <title>An Image of Imperfection: a Crucial Decision - Genesis King-Marlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Trechelle Young is a believer in love and at all cost she wanted the life that romance novels proposed as ideal. When she tackles the battle of (Ralph Young) husband, children, and happily ever after she finds that there are at least two different directions in which her marriage is traveling and the desires of her heart are not on the route. As multiple disappearing acts take premier and suspected marital flings arise Trechelle is faced with doubts of her marriage stronghold. She discovers Ralphs suspected infidelities might have reappeared after many years of believing they&#39;d stop. The question Trechelle must ask is does the infidelity stop at just women and is there more? Trechelle has also harbored deep secrets that she&#39;s tried to hide but discovers it has impact on her future just like it did her past. When Frank Henry (Ralphs co-partner) notices a damsel in distress in Trechelle and hurries to aid and see to her every need, will she take the bait and enter into a life altering experience or will she stay in her troublesome marriage, troubling past secrets she wants sealed, and piece her family image together again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of Trechelle&#39;s enters into an abusive relationship with whips, turns, and twists and has a surprising destination. The confusion drives Trechelle into a dark place she believed disappeared long ago. The big question is &quot;Who&#39;s the father?&quot; The sequel: A Crucial decision which is included as a bonus, will exemplify in magnitude, naive is for only a short time while then once the blinders are pushed aside who&#39;ll fight to regain their lives or just give up? Trechelle and Ralph children are growing and family members are making their appearances in this sequel given a more imbalanced and juicy filled distraction to already rocky lives. Whose in the closet and whose not? What will this juicy novel reveal? &lt;/p&gt;" />
