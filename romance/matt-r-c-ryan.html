  <title>Matt - R.C. Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Wild Horses Couldn&#39;t Drag Him Away From Her&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Raised beneath the big Montana sky, Matt Malloy was never meant to be a jet-setting businessman. But he&#39;ll do anything to protect the family ranch he shares with his brothers. Coming home after a two-week trip to Italy, Matt wants nothing more than to shed his suit and tie for a well-worn pair of jeans and ride his horse up to the cabin for some alone time. The last thing he needs is a big-city lawyer invading his privacy-even if she is the most beautiful woman he&#39;s ever seen . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Vanessa Kettering has devoted her life to her work. As a passionate animal rights defender, she doesn&#39;t have room for anything else. But from the moment she meets Matt, she&#39;s taken with this rugged cowboy&#39;s lazy smile and tender touch. When a raging storm traps them inside his cabin for the night, one steamy kiss leads to another, sweeping them away with a force that&#39;s as wild and untamed as the land he loves. But when the morning light comes, will she lose her heart?&lt;br&gt;" />
