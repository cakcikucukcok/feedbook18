Then she walks in on her husband canoodling with their realtor in their newly renovated kitchen, and in an instant, her perfect life comes crashing down. &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her marriage heading for divorce, Claire knows it&amp;#8217;s time to stop feeling sorry for herself. But how can she move on when she&amp;#8217;s still stuck in the orbit of her husband&amp;#8217;s world? For starters, she can get rid of her soon-to-be ex&amp;#8217;s possessions&amp;#8212;including his prized, gigantic foosball table&amp;#8212;by dumping them onto the curb&amp;#8230;until complaints from the neighbors get the police involved.

But as Claire soon learns, suburbia still has a few surprises in store for her&amp;#8212;surprises that will make her question her choices from the past, send her down an unexpected road to self-discovery, and maybe even lead to new love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desperate for a positive outlet to channel her frustrations, she turns to girlfriends Lissy and Antonia for help. Together they join forces to rebrand Lissy&amp;#8217;s local stationery store and turn it into a thriving business.
