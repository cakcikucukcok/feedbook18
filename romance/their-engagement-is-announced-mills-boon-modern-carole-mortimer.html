  <title>Their Engagement is Announced (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) - Carole Mortimer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Griffin Sinclair had announced that he and Dora Baxter were going to get married. This was a complete shock to Dora–he hadn&#39;t even asked her!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Griffin had created the fictitious engagement to avoid his mother&#39;s matchmaking–and it seemed Dora had no choice but to go along with it. Now she had to spend all her time with the gorgeous Adonis…. But it wasn&#39;t going to be that easy–because secretly, Dora had been in love with Griffin for years, and there was nothing she wanted more than his &lt;em&gt;genuine&lt;/em&gt; proposal!&lt;/p&gt;
