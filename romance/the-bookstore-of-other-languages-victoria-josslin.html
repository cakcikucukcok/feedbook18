  <title>The Bookstore of Other Languages - Victoria Josslin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bryce Hanford, aimless, drifting, and stuck, needs a spark of energy. He finds it at The Bookstore of Other Languages (&amp;ldquo;offering effortless fluency in any language through a simple and safe outpatient procedure&amp;rdquo;). Always helpful, never trustworthy, The Bookstore leads Bryce, his family, his true love, his girlfriend (oops), a couple of fraudulent co-conspirators, and a deus ex machina of questionable ethics from Seattle to Tirana to Paris, with a slight detour to Manaos. While Bryce finds it in himself to handle fraud, smuggling, and a friend&amp;rsquo;s sudden cancer diagnosis, not to mention handling Cousin Brenda, he also finds that what he really wants is someone who speaks his own language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is fitting that language is at the heart of this international story of intrigue, love, and loss. Fast paced and smartly written, Victoria Josslin examines a world where communication is both a commodity and a means to the highest form of connection. I read this book in one sitting.&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; Rebecca Judd, Branch Manager, Bainbridge Public Library&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
