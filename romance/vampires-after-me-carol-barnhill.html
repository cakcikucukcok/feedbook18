  <title>Vampires After Me - Carol Barnhill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Blood-borne Saga continues in this emotionally enthralling and riveting      story of Dr. Paul Geraud, vampire and his human wife, Alexandra. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Almost two years had passed since Paul ran from vampire hunters leaving his beloved 
Alex behind with the intent she should seek a normal life.  He was certain she would never find 
him, she was adamant that she would---and she did. After an impasse, they decide to live near 
each other, but not together as they attempt to rekindle the deep love and trust they once
shared. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	Emotional turmoil and rivalry develop when Alex meets vampire hunter, Jon Brennan, 
who romantically pursues her.  Forced to choose between her vampire husband and a man 
who could eventually destroy him,  things are further complicated when a jealous force from 
the past raises its ugly head bent on destroying her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 In an effort to save Alex, Paul must trust his rival to hide her while he attempts to 
destroy the combined forces of vampires, halflings, and mastiff dogs. He goes to battle 
insurmountable forces with the knowledge he may not survive, and if he survives, the 
fear that Alex may not choose him.
