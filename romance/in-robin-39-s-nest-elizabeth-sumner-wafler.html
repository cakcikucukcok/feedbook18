  <title>In Robin&#39;s Nest - Elizabeth Sumner Wafler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Robin Hamilton, successful New York attorney and seventies rock devotee, is poised to reveal a secret that will alter the course of three lives.
One winter evening, Robin and her adult daughter, Lark, are watching a television documentary when Lark unexpectedly spots her mother in a concert crowd, twenty-one, luminous, and perched on the shoulders of a handsome young man. That man is Larks father, Dean Falconer, though neither of them knows the truth. Robin decides its time to come clean.
Flashback to 1977. Robin Hamilton meets Dean Falconer at a rock concert in Washington, DC. The two fall in love over the course of a single transcendent weekend. 
But now Robin hasnt spoken to Dean in thirty-five years. While Lark is enthusiastic about meeting her father, Robin must deal with what could have been after three decades of loneliness and broken dreams. 
A spring full of revelations and one extraordinary summer in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia will teach these three people the ultimate measure of honesty, passion, and devotion. 
In Robins Nest is a richly detailed story of love and loss; secrecy and truth; and ultimately redemption, resplendent in poignancy and charm. Its about embracing your choices, the ties that make a family, and finding that its never too late." />
