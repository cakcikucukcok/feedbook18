  <title>The Seven Women I Once Loved - F.Tyrone Ogletree</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A woman is one of the most valuable assets that a man can have in todays society.  Ever since my early adolescence I have always tried to maintain the highest level of respect for most women.  
The purpose of this book is to look at some of the ongoing problems that men encounter in male-female relationships.  This book is not intended to degrade women in any way.  Some things mentioned in this book are from personal experience while some are just opinions.  My opinions should not be taken as being representative of all men! 
There are seven days in each week.  Each day is unique because it brings the opportunity to experience new things.  During my life I have been involved with several women, but only a significant few really meant something to me.  Even further, I can only recall seven in particular, excluding my mother, who really made a difference in my life.  I use the cardinal number seven because it is a symbolic number to me.  Like the seven days in a week, each of these women is different." />
