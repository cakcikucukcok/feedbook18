  <title>Far From Home - Charlotte Hardy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Convinced that life offers more than she can find in her small Irish village, Brid Flynn is reluctant to marry local boy Garrett Doyle. He may be the most eligible bachelor in her village, but she is not sure she loves him. And his quiet, persistent manner makes her uneasy. Then an accident brings Lord Harry Leighton, the handsome younger son of the local landowner, into her life. His beautiful features, gentle demeanor, and British accent remind Brid of the world outside of Ireland. In turn, Brid&#39;s beauty and wonderful singing voice captivate the young aristocrat. Brid is sure that the Prince Charming she has been waiting for has arrived at last. And when Harry asks her to follow him to London, she can imagine no obstacle to hold her back. But many a dream has been turned to dust by unforeseen circumstances - and Brid&#39;s new life may not be as carefree as she has envisioned." />
