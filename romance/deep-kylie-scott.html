      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don&#39;t miss a beat with the fourth and final novel in the New York Times and USA Today bestselling Stage Dive series from Kylie Scott.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positive. With two little lines on a pregnancy test, everything in Lizzy Rollins&#39; ordinary life is about to change forever. And all because of one big mistake in Vegas with Ben Nicholson, the irresistibly sexy bass player for Stage Dive. So what if Ben&#39;s the only man she&#39;s ever met who can make her feel completely safe, cherished, and out of control with desire at the same time? Lizzy knows the gorgeous rock star isn&#39;t looking for anything more permanent than a good time, no matter how much she wishes differently. &lt;br&gt;Ben knows Lizzy is off limits. Completely and utterly. She&#39;s his best friend&#39;s little sister now, and no matter how hot the chemistry is between them, no matter how sweet and sexy she is, he&#39;s not going to go there. But when Ben is forced to keep the one girl he&#39;s always had a weakness for out of trouble in Sin City, he quickly learns that what happens in Vegas, doesn&#39;t always stay there. Now he and Lizzie are connected in the deepest way possible...but will it lead to a connection of the heart?&lt;/p&gt;" />
