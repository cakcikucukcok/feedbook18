  <title>Better on Top - Delilah Dawson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Toni Lyons has her hands full raising her autistic five year old daughter, Twyla, by herself. When the opportunity comes along to make some extra money by being a tester for her friend Eileen&#39;s new erotic matchmaking website, &lt;i&gt;Orchid Soul&lt;/i&gt;, Toni is not prepared for how her life will change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nick Benson moved back into his old home after returning from the war, which has been converted into a duplex - the same one which Toni lives in. No longer the player he used to be, Nick instead fills his days renovating the old home, while grieving for his fiancé that was killed in the war. Being a former computer programmer, Eileen also involves Nick into the &lt;i&gt;Orchid Soul&lt;/i&gt; testing.  Due to a glitch in the programming, Nick and Toni are matched as a fantasy pair, and their deepest sexual desires are shared over the internet. Though she is stubborn and distant, Nick is determined to discover who she is inside, and to find the part of her that wrote some of the most erotic fantasies he&#39;s ever heard. When the wall separating their apartments comes tumbling down, a hot night of sexual reprieve becomes the start of something so much more.&lt;/p&gt;" />
