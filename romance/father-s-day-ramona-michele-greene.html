  <title>Father’S Day - Ramona Michele Greene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life is no longer simple for the famous British rockers of the band, Ministers of Parliament. Once upon a time, the headlining Parker brothers lived lives of parties and excess. Now, theyve settled down and gotten married. With a slew of sudden real-life dramatics, the theatrics of the stage seem less important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robin almost just lost his wife to an illness she picked up while on tour in Japan. Recovered from sickness, Shelly is told shes pregnant, to Robins shock and awe. Meanwhile, his brother George struggles to keep his marriage to Debra intact, and their adventurous cousin Terry has found love with the exotic Rachel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decisions need to be made. Robin fears leaving Shelly for another tour, so retirement might be his only optionbut what will that do to the rest of the band? George wonders if its even worth trying to salvage his relationship with Debra. Terry is haunted by a strange sense of impending doom where his love life is concerned. Will the Parker family find bliss, or will their decisions end in loss and pain?&lt;/p&gt;" />
