  <title>Almost Night - Andrea Cunningham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gideon Lancaster, a vampire warrior and member of the High Anarchy (a highly elusive group of vampires fighting in rebellion against their king, Zeke Argonimas) has lived a lifetime of war and pain. He desires nothing but death for the immoral vampire king who murdered his bride and left his home and heart smoldering with fire and revenge. That is, until he meets the beautiful Hannah Papillon. He&#39;s immediately smitten by her kindness and her benevolent compassion for her family and people. In her arms, he&#39;s ready to love again, if only he can protect her from the menacing vampire king who had so viciously torn his world apart.
Hannah Papillon, Princess of Mantolpiah, the land of elves, is from an ancient tribe of demons thought to exist only in myth. The gods of Antarcious (the gods of her heritage) have forever protected her people from other lands by shielding them with a magical mist. Her life is quiet and tranquil, until she learns that the mist is fading and will soon expose her peaceful world to the dangerous demons who surround it. All seems lost, until fate slams her face-to-face with the incredibly handsome Gideon Lancaster, whom she has been advised to fear and rebuke. But her heart tells her differently. And when circumstance finds her in the hands of Zeke Argonimas, the High Fiend of Goosnargh (the land of vampires), she&#39;s forced to trust in Gideon&#39;s damaged love to save her." />
