  <title>Fight Fire With Fire - Amy J. Fetzer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;No Turning Back&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Dragon One operative Riley Donovan is an expert at bringing &#39;em back alive, but his latest assignment takes an extreme detour when his prey is captured.  .  .by someone else. Before you can say &quot;international incident,&quot; CIA agent Safia Troy has entered the fray. It just so happens the arms dealer Safia&#39;s after is the same scum who grabbed Donovan&#39;s man. If anyone can give Riley a run for his money in the kick-butt-then-take-names department, it&#39;s Safia. Not that Riley minds: he loves to watch her work.  .  .   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Safia never thought she&#39;d see Riley again since saving his life years ago--yet here he is, hotter than ever. If she must partner up, Riley certainly satisfies &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; her requirements. But Safia hasn&#39;t bargained for the twisted places this case will lead, revealing secrets about her past even she didn&#39;t know. Now, as Safia&#39;s drawn deeper into the heart of darkness, Riley&#39;s the only one she wants by her side.  .  ." />
