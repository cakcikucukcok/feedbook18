        &lt;p&gt;and Caroline Sommerfield knew at a glance that business mogul Stephen Monterey had written off any prospect of joy for himself.

But that was before Caroline Sommerfield danced her way into his ordered existence, creating her own special chaos and determined to rewrite the story of his life…!&lt;/p&gt;
