  <title>A Broken Promise - Cornell L. Brent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After jumping from one relationship to the next and making careless mistakes during adolescence, Xavier Gibson could not stop until he found unconditional love. Suddenly, one night, he met a girl who had a crush on him named Naomi, leaving her with a kiss that convinced her into thinking that they were a couple. Xavier was already in an unhappy relationship but was unexpectedly falling head over heels in love with Naomi. When Naomi found out that she was a fool by revealing the fact that he was already with someone else and lying to her, she moved away and disappeared. While battling with guilt and a naive girlfriend, Xavier did everything he could to prove to Naomi that he was sorry and wanted to get back together. Sooner or later, he was dumped by his girlfriend, and after finally reuniting with Naomi, they fell deeply in love and stood by each others side in desperation, no matter what people thought or disliked. They were so happy that they made a promise to always be honest and faithful as they got older. Until one of them failed the temptation of infidelity, turning an open mind into a closet of secrets. What happens at the end will blow your mind!" />
