~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Our situation doesn&amp;#39;t work for me any longer,&amp;quot; he continued, cutting her off with an impatient gesture. &amp;quot;I want more than sex with you, but I also need more.&amp;quot; Moodily he walked over to a window and stared out for a few seconds, then turned back to face her. &amp;quot;It may have started out innocently, but my feelings for you have grown. I don&amp;#39;t want to share you anymore. John&amp;#39;s a great guy and I never wanted to hurt your marriage, but I won&amp;#39;t lie about my feelings. It&amp;#39;s just not enough anymore.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She sat down abruptly. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I don&amp;#39;t know what to say, either,&amp;quot; she added after a long, baffled moment. &amp;quot;My feelings for you have grown, too...but you know I love my husband.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Annoyed, he raked both hands through his short black hair. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re not even going to give us a chance, are you?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She stared at him in cautious confusion. &amp;quot;What do you mean?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Abruptly he crossed back to her, and clasped her hands. &amp;quot;Stay.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Stay?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes, stay.&amp;quot; The words tumbled out of him at high speed. &amp;quot;Your return flight isn&amp;#39;t until Saturday. That&amp;#39;s still four days away. Stay with me this week. We can see if we&amp;#39;re really a good match or not. We can spend time together like a normal couple. You can meet my friends, and we can get to know each other outside the bedroom.&amp;quot; He chuckled suddenly. &amp;quot;We already know we&amp;#39;re compatible in the bedroom.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;DeShawn...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He cut her off again by gently kissing her. &amp;quot;Please?&amp;quot; Then he took a deep breath, and added, &amp;quot;I also want you to meet my parents.&amp;quot;" />
