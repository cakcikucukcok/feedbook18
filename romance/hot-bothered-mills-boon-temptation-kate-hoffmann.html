  <title>Hot &amp; Bothered (Mills &amp; Boon Temptation) - Kate Hoffmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;The Heat Is On…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Trey Marbury receives an erotic anonymous note, he knows only one woman could have written it–Libby Parrish. As teenagers, he and Libby had once gone skinny-dipping to escape the South Carolina heat–and ended up generating even more heat in each other&#39;s arms. Twelve years later, Trey is worried about how she&#39;ll react to his return. But her steamy invitation tells him she&#39;s more than ready to pick up where they left off…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Libby has spent the past twelve years trying to get over Trey. But once he shows up on her doorstep, she can&#39;t stop herself from falling into his arms and his bed. Still, Libby can&#39;t help wondering if Trey intends to love her–then leave her–again. Luckily a letter shows up in her mailbox, a red-hot message that makes all her reservations melt away….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It looks like the start of a beautiful relationship–until they realize the letters were written by somebody else….&lt;/p&gt;
