  <title>My Guardian Angel - Antonia Marie Watts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My Guardian Angel
Shawna Caden, a goth-styled, Christian metal musician, follows her mission to shine her light at the Gates Of Hell biker rally; but her flame is nearly extinguished when she slowly awakens to macabre chanting and a cold steel blade to her throat.
Shawna had always struggled with the question, am I doing Gods will or feeding my own desires?  When she enters The Pit, that answer is further veiled in obscurity.  She enters the realm of her antithesis, the dark and ominous Sandman, who fills her heart with both terror and intrigue; leading her into a world she had long left behind.  Only her Guardian Angel can save her from being the chosen one.  They were two strangers brought together by the darkest situation they had ever faced.  But can God forgive her when she gives him both her soul and her body?  In their tumultuous plight from the evil that pursues them they find an everlasting love that can never be broken." />
