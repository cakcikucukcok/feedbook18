  <title>Playing the Field - Jennifer Seasons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The sexy baseball players of Jennifer Seasons&amp;#39; Diamonds and Dugouts series are back with the story of a single mom, a hot rookie, and a second chance at love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single mother Sonny Miller has spent years avoiding love. A rotten childhood and an even rottener ex-boyfriend left her determined to protect her son&amp;#8212;and herself&amp;#8212;against the risks of romance. That is, until hotshot ballplayer JP Trudeau swaggers into her carefully constructed life, all sin-with-me eyes and irresistible grin. Sonny can&amp;#8217;t help but feel drawn to the sexy, confident man, even as every fiber of her being tells her to keep running the bases . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP is known for being fast on his feet, not fast with his heart. But meeting Sonny and her boy sparks something in him&amp;#8212;something he&amp;#8217;s never felt before, not from all the cleat- chasers in the major leagues. Sonny may be hell-bent on keeping him at arm&amp;#8217;s length no matter what, but this rookie has a plan. To get the girl, he must step up to the plate and convince her to take another chance on love . . . before this game gets rained out.&lt;/p&gt;" />
