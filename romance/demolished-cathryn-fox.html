  <title>Demolished - Cathryn Fox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Cathryn Fox comes the first in the hot new Blue Bay Crew series that follows the sexy, blue collar Owens men who take over their family&#39;s construction business in the small town of Blue Bay, CT. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Summer Wheeler is on the run. Hiding from the men who killed her father, Summer is on her way to her childhood cottage in Blue Bay when she runs into Sean Owens, the forbidden bad boy from her past. After giving him a fake name, she gives in to one steamy night with him, never expecting to see him again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sean isn&#39;t sure why Summer is pretending to be someone she&#39;s not, but he&#39;ll play her game if that means he can indulge in one of his oldest fantasies - a night with Summer. He&#39;s shocked to see her when he returns to Blue Bay, and even more surprised when Summer offers him a job renovating her old family cottage. Hot workdays turn into hotter nights, but when Summer&#39;s secret catches up with her, she&#39;ll have to decide if she can trust Sean with her heart--and her life. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Demolished &lt;/i&gt;nails the perfect combination of emotion, scorching intensity, and a touch of suspense that will draw readers to this fantastic new series!&lt;/p&gt;" />
