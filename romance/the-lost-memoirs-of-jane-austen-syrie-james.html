  <title>The Lost Memoirs of Jane Austen - Syrie James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many rumors abound about a mysterious gentleman said to be the love of Jane&#39;s life&amp;#8212;finally, the truth may have been found. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if, hidden in an old attic chest, Jane Austen&#39;s memoirs were discovered after hundreds of years? What if those pages revealed the untold story of a life-changing love affair? That&#39;s the premise behind this spellbinding novel, which delves into the secrets of Jane Austen&#39;s life, giving us untold insights into her mind and heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jane Austen has given up her writing when, on a fateful trip to Lyme, she meets the well-read and charming Mr. Ashford, a man who is her equal in intellect and temperament. Inspired by the people and places around her, and encouraged by his faith in her, Jane begins revising &lt;em&gt;Sense and Sensibility&lt;/em&gt;, a book she began years earlier, hoping to be published at last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deft and witty, written in a style that echoes Austen&#39;s own, this unforgettable novel offers a delightfully possible scenario for the inspiration behind this beloved author&#39;s romantic tales. It&#39;s a remarkable book, irresistible to anyone who loves Jane Austen&amp;#8212;and to anyone who loves a great story. &lt;/p&gt;" />
