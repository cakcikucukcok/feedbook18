  <title>Coming Around Again - Jim Van Loozen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the midst of writing a trilogy of murder mysteries (including his debut novel, &quot;A Ghost of a Chance&quot;) Jim Van Loozen was inspired to take a turn at Romance with a story touching the bases on friendship, love, loyalty, attraction, and seduction. The result was the thought provoking &quot;Coming Around Again.&quot; 
After Shaun ORielly decides to end nine months of mourning the death of his wife Andrea to reconnect with his stockbroker friends and teammates on an amateur baseball team, he discovers that a new guy is playing his position at second base. Unknown to all, the interloper is his late wife whose tinkering with reincarnation has resulted in her coming around again as a man. Shaun finds himself strangely attracted to the new guy. 
As Shaun&#39;s attraction and his confusion grow, new guy Andy Stock seeks to seduce Shaun into becoming lovers, much to the chagrin of their homophobic coach and best friend, Buddy Ross. Buddy attempts to &quot;fix&quot; Shaun by setting him up with an overnight date with an attractive woman. But as the new guy reveals the truth about his true identity, Shaun&#39;s conventions are shaken to their foundations. Which mate will he choose?" />
