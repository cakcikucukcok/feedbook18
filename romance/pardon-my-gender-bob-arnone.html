  <title>Pardon My Gender - Bob Arnone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have a better idea, you pompous jerk. Nora huffed. I challenge you to a thirty-six-hole two-day golf match. You win, and Ill resign from the club  I win  and the rules around here change. Nora told him, fire in her eyes and hands on hips.&lt;p&gt;
Steeped in tradition, the Happy Hills Country Club in Huntington, Long Island, was originally built as a gentlemens club, a refuge for men. Although women are allowed to play on the course, they are granted few rights and amenities. Fortyfive-year-old New York businessman Bill Harper detests the idea of women playing on the course. But feisty Nora Cummings seeks to make some changes.&lt;p&gt;
Nora challenges Bill to a two-day, thirty-six-hole golf tournament. If she wins, the club must provide parity for women. If he wins, the widowed Nora must resign from the club. Backed by the board of directors and its president Mike Grace, the millionaire bachelor Bill accepts the challenge and is determined to rid the club of Nora the troublemaker. The challenge becomes a local and national spectacle when the National Organization of Women and a major television network take interest.&lt;p&gt;
While preparing for the contest, Nora begins to date her golf coach, George. But a chance meeting between Nora and Bill off the course and an innocent cup of coffee could change the outcome of the contest and the rest of their lives." />
