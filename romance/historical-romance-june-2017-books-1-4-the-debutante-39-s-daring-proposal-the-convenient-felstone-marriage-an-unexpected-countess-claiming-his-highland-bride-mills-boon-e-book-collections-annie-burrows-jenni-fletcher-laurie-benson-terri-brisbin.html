        &lt;h2&gt;Take a step in time with four historical romances…&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Debutante&#39;s Daring Proposal&lt;/em&gt; by Annie Burrows&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘I want you to marry me.’&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Miss Georgiana Wickford has a plan to avoid the marriage mart—she’ll propose a marriage of convenience! She hasn’t spoken to the Earl of Ashenden since their childhood friendship was torn apart, but now Edmund is her only hope.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Edmund refuses to take any bride, especially the unsuitable country miss who abandoned him years ago. But when he sees beautiful Georgie at the mercy of society’s rakes it arouses his protective instincts. And soon the Earl is tempted to claim the daring debutante for himself!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Convenient Felstone Marriage&lt;/em&gt; by Jenni Fletcher&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘I have a proposal for you…’&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The last place respectable governess Ianthe Holt ever expected to be proposed to is in a train carriage…by a stranger…who has just accused her of trying to trap another man into marriage!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Shipping magnate Robert Felstone may be dashing but he’s also insufferable, impertinent—and Ianthe’s only possible saviour from her uncertain fate. She’s hesitant to play the perfect Felstone wife, but Robert soon shows Ianthe there’s more to him than meets the eye, and more to marriage than vows…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Unexpected Countess&lt;/em&gt; by Laurie Benson&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘Dash it, Miss Forrester, what are you doing up here?’&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Earl of Hartwick delights in scandalising the Ton with his behaviour. But it’s his turn to be scandalised when, on one of his escapades, he bumps into Miss Sarah Forrester—in the rain, at night, on a rooftop!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sarah is hunting for a diamond, and the last thing she needs is the infuriating Hart distracting her. But he’s looking for the jewel too! They might be rivals, but the sparks between them are uncontrollable. And soon Sarah finds herself longing for another treasure—becoming Hart’s countess!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Claiming His Highland Bride&lt;/em&gt; by Terri Brisbin&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Safe in her Highlander’s arms!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Discovering her role in her father’s plot to destroy another clan, Sorcha MacMillan risks her life to go into hiding. Her safety relies on her disguise, but she is drawn to a man who could see through her…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Unknown to Sorcha, Alan Cameron has been sent to track her down. He’s attracted to the woman in disguise. Even discovering her true identity, he can’t overcome his instinct to protect her. No matter the danger, he will keep Sorcha safe…and claim her as his bride!&lt;/p&gt;
