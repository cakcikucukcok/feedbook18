  <title>Hot City Nights - Clara Darling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There aren&#39;t many rules that gorgeous glamour model Bella Steele hasn&#39;t broken.  However, there is one she&#39;s always observed: best friends should never compete for men, jobs, or real estate. When Maya Lin, the stunning Asian beauty Bella took under her wing when she began modeling, is named the Penthouse Pet of the Month, Bella&#39;s rule is challenged: the two friends find themselves rivals for the title of ultimate sex bomb - Pet of the Year.  It&#39;s a trophy Bella&#39;s always wanted, and she&#39;s not about to take this challenge lying down.  Maya has a few tricks up her garter herself, and New York City will never be the same as these sultry sirens face off at its hottest clubs and photo ops.&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, Sophie Steele, Bella&#39;s younger sister, leaves the world of professional poker to reclaim her dominance in the banking world - a decision that threatens her relationship with her boyfriend, Tai. And the only way into her dream job at a hot new hedge fund  is through former frenemy Regina Chase. Regina has spent most of her time since moving to New York looking for love in all the wrong places.  She longs for Sophie&#39;s breezy, confident style--can she unleash her own wild side by joining the erotic after-hours scene?&lt;/p&gt;" />
