  <title>Taima&#39;s Woman - Trish Dudek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Margaret is not a conventional woman of the early-nineteenth century. Shes not interested in pretty dresses and tea parties, but instead longs for adventure in the great outdoors. Margaret convinces her father, William, to seek opportunity in the fur trade business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They embark on a journey that follows the Louis and Clark route along the Missouri River into Blackfoot country to trade for beaver skins. As she gains freedom from the social structures that bind her in the East, she doesnt anticipate the changes this new life brings. The travelers face an array of challenges from the weather, wild animals, and the native Indian tribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margaret thrives in this wild country, where she catches sight of Taima, the Thunder Horse, who refuses to be caught. Together with Night Hawk, a warrior in the Black Horse Band of the Kainah Blackfoot, they both seek to capture this beautiful, wild horse. Night Hawk believes the elusive Taima will fulfill his dreams. He doesnt expect his plansor his lifeto be complicated by a Long Knife woman with similar dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margaret, Night Hawk, and Taima gain honor and strength from each othera strength that is shared with the Black Horse Bandproviding a link to the future that could have been.&lt;/p&gt;" />
