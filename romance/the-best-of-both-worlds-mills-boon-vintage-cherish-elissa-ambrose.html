          &lt;strong&gt;HOW TO DESCRIBE BECKY ROTH: UNEMPLOYED, STRESSED, PREGNANT&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After losing her job at a greasy diner, Becky needed to support herself, but no one was looking for a pregnant vegetarian chef during a snowstorm in small-town Connecticut. Except Carter Prescott III, who&#39;d been the best man at a wedding a few months ago where he and Becky had indulged in a little too much cake…and lovemaking. Now that he was going to be a father, he had to convince her he was ready for marriage and a baby. But no one was more surprised than Carter when his feelings of obligation turned into full-blown passion and need. Suddenly, he was a man on a mission–marriage!&lt;/p&gt;
