  <title>Sweet Salt Air - Barbara Delinsky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;On Quinnipeague, hearts open under the summer stars and secrets float in the &lt;i&gt;Sweet Salt Air&lt;/i&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charlotte and Nicole were once the best of friends, spending summers together in Nicole&#39;s coastal island house off of Maine. But many years, and many secrets, have kept the women apart. A successful travel writer, single Charlotte lives on the road, while Nicole, a food blogger, keeps house in Philadelphia with her surgeon-husband, Julian. When Nicole is commissioned to write a book about island food, she invites her old friend Charlotte back to Quinnipeague, for a final summer, to help. Outgoing and passionate, Charlotte has a gift for talking to people and making friends, and Nicole could use her expertise for interviews with locals. Missing a genuine connection, Charlotte agrees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what both women don&#39;t know is that they are each holding something back that may change their lives forever. For Nicole, what comes to light could destroy her marriage, but it could also save her husband. For Charlotte, the truth could cost her Nicole&#39;s friendship, but could also free her to love again. And her chance may lie with a reclusive local man, with a heart to soothe and troubles of his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Bestselling author and master storyteller Barbara Delinsky invites you come away to Quinnipeague...&lt;/p&gt;" />
