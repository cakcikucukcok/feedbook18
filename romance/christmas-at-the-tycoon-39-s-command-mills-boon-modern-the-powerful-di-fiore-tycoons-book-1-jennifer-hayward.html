  <title>Christmas At The Tycoon&#39;s Command (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) (The Powerful Di Fiore Tycoons, Book 1) - Jennifer Hayward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Billionaire boss’s festive seduction!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Shy Chloe Russo is dreading her first Christmas running the family business. Working with Nico Di Fiore is the last straw! Once, Nico’s kisses promised Chloe every sensual delight, until he coldly rejected her. Now, he’s her very commanding, very arrogant boss!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Control is paramount to Nico—after his father’s bankruptcy lost him everything, nothing will distract him from succeeding. He’s always kept a tight rein on his craving for Chloe, well-aware she alone has the power to disarm him. But now, unable to deny their connection, Nico is determined to reclaim control, and take Chloe as his own!&lt;/p&gt;
