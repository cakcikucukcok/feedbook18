      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Four sexy stories guaranteed to heat up the start to your summer reading...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Private Reserve&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When good girl Olivia discovers my dark side, she may run home. She doesn&#39;t understand what becoming my wife in every sense of the word might mean. What she doesn&#39;t know is she already owns me, and if she leaves, I&#39;ll never be the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;House Rules &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know Kennedy Lane is hands off, but I want her. I always have. She might have been too young for me back in the day. Now, not so much. Hands off leads to hands on after a private dance, and while Kennedy spends the weekend pretending to be someone she isn&#39;t, I know full well who she is. And I&#39;m not quite ready to let her go. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Under Pressure&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Veterinarian, Reese Scott&#39;s vacation is supposed to be spent having hot monkey sex with a stranger. So why is her super sexy best friend Cole Rayburn involved in her adventure? When she finds herself inside a shark cage and in his arms, she knows she has to do something about it. But what if she tries to seduce her best friend and he rejects her? More importantly...what if he doesn&#39;t?&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Big Catch &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former New York stockbroker, Brayden Adams takes one look at Alyssa and knows she needs to relax. He&#39;d known the feeling himself, until he and his best friend, Tyler, left the fast life behind when they inherited a hotel and fishing business in Antiqua. Now they live a relaxed island life and share everything. But Alyssa makes him question everything he knows.&lt;/p&gt;" />
