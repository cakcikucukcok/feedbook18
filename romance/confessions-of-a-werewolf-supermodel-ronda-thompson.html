  <title>Confessions of a Werewolf Supermodel - Ronda Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Supermodel Lou Kipinski seems to have it all. But beauty is only skin deep--and sometimes Lou&#39;s porcelain complexion can get a bit hairy. The only thing worse than a furry fashion faux-pas? Fangs in her million-dollar smile. That&#39;s what happened six months ago, when Lou had her first outbreak. But now that she&#39;s at the height of her career she absolutely &lt;i&gt;must &lt;/i&gt;find a cure...So what&#39;s a single werewolf gotta do? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then a sexy detective comes knocking on her door. Two women who bear an eerie resemblance to Lou have been killed--something with teeth and claws tore them apart. Is it a coincidence that the grisly murders have taken place during the same time as Lou&#39;s own outbreaks? With a killer at her heels and another outbreak just a concealer-wand&#39;s distance away, Lou is soon in a race to discover truths about her own murky past. And before it&#39;s all over she may be forced to show the world that her bark is nothing compared to her bite...&lt;/p&gt;" />
