  <title>Hard-Riding Cowboy - Stacey Kennedy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Megan Harrison is the owner of &lt;i&gt;Kinky Spurs. &lt;/i&gt;She&#39;s mortgaged up to her eyeballs and works long days and nights, but she&#39;s living life on her terms, not on her wealthy father&#39;s. She&#39;s done being in the cattle rancher&#39;s shadow. She&#39;s got it all figured out, except for the part that involves Nash Blackshaw. He&#39;s a sexy as hell cowboy whose smile can easily charm her out of her tight jeans. The only problem is--their fathers were business rivals, and Megan and Nash have been taught to hate each other since birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nash Blackshaw, a retired professional bull rider, has responsibilities on top of responsibilities. With his PBR career over due to back injury, and his focus narrowed on heading up the Blackshaw Cattle Company&#39;s Guest Ranch, he shouldn&#39;t have time to think about all the ways he wants Megan. But it&#39;s all he thinks of around the sassy and sweet woman. She might be forbidden to him, but Nash wants to take her for a hard, kinky ride. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But small towns have a way of spreading gossip like wildfire, and not everyone is happy about their relationship. Especially when Megan drops a bombshell on Nash after one heated night between them. As much as Megan and Nash want to forget the old feud between their fathers and lose each other in explosive passion, they can&#39;t escape reality. They are meant to be enemies, and Nash&#39;s sizzling, dominant touch might not be enough to keep them together.&lt;/p&gt;" />
