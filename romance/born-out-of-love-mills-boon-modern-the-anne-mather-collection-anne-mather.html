  <title>Born Out of Love (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) (The Anne Mather Collection) - Anne Mather</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; Mills &amp; Boon are excited to present The Anne Mather Collection – the complete works by this classic author made available to download for the very first time! These books span six decades of a phenomenal writing career, and every story is available to read unedited and untouched from their original release.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Is it time to reveal her secret?&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Widowed Charlotte never expects to see Logan Kennedy again. But she does – and in the most unlikely of places! Charlotte has travelled halfway across the world to the Virgin islands to start a new life with her young son Robert – but how can she move on now Logan has appeared on the scene? Especially when she realises her attraction to him as powerful as ever… Can they ever forgive each other for the mistakes of the past? And how will Logan react when he discovers Charlotte’s secret - that Robert is in fact Logan’s son?!&lt;/p&gt;
