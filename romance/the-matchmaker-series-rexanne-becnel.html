  <title>The Matchmaker Series - Rexanne Becnel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Together for the first time in an exclusive e-book collection,  four lush and romantic regency novels by award-winning author Rexanne Becnel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This Matchmaker Series collection includes:&lt;br&gt;                      &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; The Matchmaker&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since her entry into society three years ago, Olivia has kept detailed notes on every eligible man with whom she&#39;s ever sipped a cup of tea or twirled across the dance floor. Some of her diary entries have resulted in successful matches for her friends, but she&#39;s never found any man she considered remotely suitable for herself. But once Lord Neville Hawke comes into her life, the other men in her book look positively perfect. Neville&#39;s a notorious scoundrel with a shady and painful past, and a penchant for destroying rooms in fits of drunken rage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Troublemaker&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt; Sarah Palmer, a reckless beauty with a penchant for trouble, has enraged her family for the last time with her foiled plan to elope with a fortune hunter. Sent to stay with her married half-sister in the Scottish countryside, Sarah arrives there only to learn that her sister has gone away to Glasgow. With no one to chaperone her, she is immensely relieved at her newfound freedom and vows to redeem herself in the eyes of her family by behaving for once. But she hasn&#39;t reckoned on Marshall MacDougal, the most irresistible and troublesome man she has ever met...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Bridemaker&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; She&#39;s called &quot;the Bridemaker&quot;, but Hester Poitevant prefers to think of herself as the gentle facilitator of marital union. Hester&#39;s popular Mayfair Academy has helped teach many the awkward society miss how to find her way to the altar with the eligible bachelor of her choice. But while her students flirt and mingle, Hester possesses as a prim widow--rather than reveal herself as the never-been married beauty she truly is...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Heartbreaker&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; The London Tattler - February 6&lt;br&gt; An ugly rumor has arisen, only to be proven no rumor at all, but rather, the unadulterated truth. It seems the proper Lord Farley has behaved in a decidedly improper manner...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; James Lindford, Viscount Farley, has returned from the Orient, feted and celebrated ...until his past catches up with him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
