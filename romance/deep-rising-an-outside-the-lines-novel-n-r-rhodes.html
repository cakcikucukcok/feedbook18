  <title>Deep Rising (An Outside the Lines Novel) - N.R. Rhodes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Deep Rising by N.R. Rhodes&lt;br&gt;In his nine-year stint with the CIA, Jared Caldwell thought he&#39;d seen it all. But when his latest mission instructs him to apprehend a beautiful scientist who&#39;s allegedly linked to a devastating new form of warfare, he isn&#39;t prepared for the prospect of battling man-made tsunamis--or the misplaced feelings he harbors for his number one suspect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The irony of being accused of crimes her research was intended to prevent isn&#39;t lost on Svetlana Orskya. She also didn&#39;t expect her wish for a strong, sexy man to sweep in and change her life to come true--especially not when he appears, gun in hand, pointed at her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But time is running out and Jared and Lana must work together to protect the mainland. As the heat between them--and the threat of mass destruction--rises there is more at stake than just their hearts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
