  <title>The Schemer (A Hot Romantic Comedy) - Avery Flynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Don&#39;t miss the hot new romantic comedy follow-up to the smash hit &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Charmer... &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyler Jacobson has a plan for everything--except how to handle his completely annoying, utterly frustrating, and totally sexy upstairs neighbor. He couldn&#39;t care less if Everly Ribinski thinks he&#39;s equally irritating--until he discovers she&#39;s the only one who can help him land a business deal that will finally make him feel like he&#39;s more than just a guy from the wrong side of the tracks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Color him shocked when Everly refuses to help, insisting she should have run him over in the parking garage when she had the chance. Harsh. But possibly deserved. Tyler may have spent the last few months reveling in annoying the fiery gallery owner with a dark past, but he&#39;s got secret leverage she can&#39;t refuse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If only they could stop trying to one-up each other long enough to realize the pranks are nothing more than foreplay. Of course, he figures it out quicker. He&#39;s smart like that. Too bad Everly wants nothing to do with him. Or does she? Wait. What is she up to now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a man who&#39;s always scheming, the best-laid plans never felt so good falling apart...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Harbor City series is STANDALONE&lt;br&gt;* The Negotiator&lt;br&gt;* The Charmer&lt;br&gt;* The Schemer&lt;/p&gt;" />
