  <title>His Sister Slave - Zoe Black</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sophie is bored. Her brother Brian is a pervert. More importantly, he has money, and he&amp;#39;s completely safe. Or so she thinks. But when she begins posing for his pictures for money she awakens a side of herself she hadn&amp;#39;t known existed, and as her poses become darker and more graphic, clad in bondage wear, then turn X-rated, she slowly falls into the role of obedient, feverishly thrilled sexual save.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What kind of pictures?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;More lingerie pictures. She didn&amp;rsquo;t like the last ones. She said the light was wrong.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sophie snorted disdainfully, but she was feeling kind of happy, and flirty, and high and hot, and the prospect of money and preening in front of a guy, even her brother Brian were both quite attractive. So she shrugged and agreed, finished her joint, and stripped off her top, then began to pose for the camera.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You have a great body,&amp;rdquo; he said as he snapped the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She snorted disdainfully, but then had a wild thought. Why not? He was male, and she was feeling horny. But he was her brother. She could walk back and forth naked in front of him without anything happening.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not that her mind wasn&amp;rsquo;t a little fuzzy when she thought about it. Not that she really thought about it, either, so much as had a dumb impulse.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A slow smile curled her lips up and she slowly slid her bra down, baring her breasts inch by inch as she arched her back again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They were excellent breasts. She was a very fit girl, her body very toned and athletic. Her breasts were not large, for she had never had much, if any fat on her. But they were a firm, very round, very attractive pair with small pink nipples and puffy areolas. Her last boyfriend, Paul, had told her often enough that her breasts were absolutely perfect, and from what she&amp;rsquo;d seen of others, he was right.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So she felt a dark pride as she flashed him, flashed the camera really. Her face flushed a little, but it was hard to be embarrassed in front of Brian. After all &amp;ndash; it was Brian.&lt;br /&gt;
She knew, as well, that she was teasing him, taunting him. Had he ever had a nice pair of breasts like that so close to him? Was he still a virgin? But then, taunting little brothers was a part of life, and fun in itself, no matter how you did it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She slowly writhed on the sofa, giving him a coy look as the camera flashed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You like?&amp;rdquo; she purred.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You have great tits,&amp;rdquo; he said, his voice a bit husky.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She laughed in delight and pulled the bra back up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll put these on the internet,&amp;rdquo; he said threateningly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She smirked at him and gave him the finger again, not the least bit worried. He would do no such thing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I could put it on the internet and hide your face,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yeah?&amp;rdquo; she took another smoke, mildly interested in the idea.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that Sophie was an exhibitionist, but she did have a certain measure of pride in her body, and a certain smug satisfaction at the way men appreciated its curves and firmness.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you arch back over the side of the sofa nobody could even see your face,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yeah, so what?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Come on, Sophie. I dare you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She made a face, but then had another dumb impulse, and so she did it, pulling her bra off. At first she covered her breasts with her arms, but then she drew them apart, feeling a delicious shock-wave of excitement as she exposed her perfect breasts, arching her back, drawing her head far back as the camera flashed again and again." />
