As they grow closer, Sarah nervously reveals she is pregnant. Marcus, who is carrying baggage from his own failed relationship, accepts Sarah just as she is. After they finally fall in love, marry, and Marcus begins raising the child as his own, neither has an idea that her past is about to rise up and send them both down a terrifying path where nothing is certain.
