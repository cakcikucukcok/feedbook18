  <title>Touch of a Thief - Mia Marlowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;London&#39;s most talented criminal is about to be fingered.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lady Viola Preston can relieve a gentleman of the studs at his wrists without his being any the wiser and pick any lock devised by man in less than a minute. But she&#39;s careful to wear gloves when she steals jewels. Because when Viola touches a gemstone with her bare skin, it &quot;speaks&quot; to her, sending disturbing visions&amp;#8212;visions almost as unsettling as the sight of the cool-eyed stranger who catches her red handed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Viola will only be stealing at Greydon Quinn&#39;s behest. And even more daunting than the violent history of the red diamond he&#39;s after is the prospect of a night in the devastatingly handsome lieutenant&#39;s arms. Touch has always been Viola&#39;s weakness, and the full body-to-body contact Quinn has in mind is about to shatter her defenses and set her senses reeling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More Praise for Mia Marlow and &lt;i&gt;Touch of a Thief&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;Mia Marlow is a rising star! Hot and steamy.  .  .a&amp;#160;sensually satisfying read.  .  .a page turner.&quot; &amp;#8212;New York Times bestselling author Connie Mason&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;Mia Marlowe proves she has the &quot;touch&quot; for strong heroines, wickedly sexy heroes, and love scenes so hot they singe the pages.&quot; &amp;#8212;Jennifer Ashley, &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Lady Isabella&#39;s Scandalous Marriage&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;Adventure lovers rejoice as the race is on to find a rare, powerful jewel with an alluring thief and intriguing hero.&quot; &amp;#8212;Barbara Vey&lt;/b&gt;" />
