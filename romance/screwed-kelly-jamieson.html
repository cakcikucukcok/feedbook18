  <title>Screwed - Kelly Jamieson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A sizzling forbidden romance.&quot; - #1 &lt;i&gt;NYT&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller Lauren Blakely&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cash Hale has been in love with his best friend&#39;s wife forever. Now Callie and Beau are divorced, but she&#39;s still way off-limits. Dating her would betray his friendship with Beau. And Cash is nothing if not loyal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Callie Sutherland is starting over. The end of her marriage was just one more way she failed to live up to her wealthy family&#39;s expectations, so from now on she&#39;s not even going to try. It&#39;s time to live her life the way she wants. And she wants Cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cash and Beau aren&#39;t just friends, they&#39;re business partners, and the drop in the price of oil has hurt their business. They &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; to win the bid for Sutherland Industries&#39; next big project--but it may get messy since Callie&#39;s family owns the business. Not only would Cash risk his friendship with Beau to be with her, he&#39;d be risking the company they worked so hard to create. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this new Callie isn&#39;t taking no for an answer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&#39;s so screwed...&lt;/p&gt;" />
