          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;WHEN IT&#39;S THIS CLOSE…&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Bradshaw&#39;s wellordered life has just taken a detour. Instead of being in L.A. making the pitch of his career, he&#39;s stuck in Alaska with a feisty bush pilot. Seductive, independent Cyd Thompson has him so captivated, he&#39;s not even thinking about his career. All Jeffrey can focus on is the snow-melting heat he and Cyd create. He&#39;ll let his newly discovered twin handle L.A. until he&#39;s gotten Cyd out of his system.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;MAYBE THE ONLY THING TO DO IS GET CLOSER!&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cyd wants Jeffrey…she just doesn&#39;t want him here. His big-city plans are bound to destroy the Alaska she loves. So she&#39;ll do anything she can to distract him from finalizing his business. And if that means seducing the guy…well, she&#39;ll do that. But she doesn&#39;t count on falling for Jeffrey&#39;s intoxicating kisses.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So what else can Cyd do but convince him that in the Arctic, there&#39;s no such thing as getting too close for comfort?&lt;/p&gt;
