I would&#39;ve stayed away longer if I hadn&#39;t received the letter. Not a day has gone by that I haven&#39;t thought about her, haven&#39;t missed her smile, haven&#39;t wished that things were different.&lt;br&gt;  The last time I saw my two best friends, I vowed to not stand in the way of their happiness, even if that meant I couldn&#39;t be a part of their lives. Cameron James and her emerald-green eyes were too much of a temptation and I couldn&#39;t stay and watch them together. Cameron deserved better than me. She deserved him.&lt;br&gt;  But now that I am back, things are different. I&#39;m not going to stand by and watch the woman I&#39;ve always loved slip away again. I&#39;m done living my life with regrets and I&#39;m ready to tell her the truth. And I&#39;ll do whatever it takes to show her that I always wished she was mine." />
