        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;BEAUTY AND THE RANGER&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The surprise of his life awaited David Hartwell at the top of the Montana mountain: besides a sprawling mansion, he&#39;d also inherited his late father&#39;s ward. Beautiful, enticing Ellen Candler didn&#39;t flee at the sight of his scarred face. Because she couldn&#39;t see it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Although she was blind, Ellen had never given up hope of one day recovering her sight. But she didn&#39;t need her eyes to tell her this overpoweringly masculine forest ranger was running away from something. While he was coaxing her down from her sheltered mountain existence, Ellen was secretly waging her own campaign of seduction to turn her reluctant guardian into a loving mate…for life.&lt;/p&gt;
