  <title>Obsession - Jennifer L. Armentrout</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hunter is a ruthless killer. And the Department of Defense has him firmly in their grasp, which usually doesn&#39;t chafe too badly because he gets to kill bad guys. Most of the time he enjoys his job. That is, until he&#39;s saddled with something he&#39;s never had to do before: protect a human from his mortal enemy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Serena Cross didn&#39;t believe her best friend when she claimed to have seen the son of a powerful senator turn into something...unnatural. Who would? But then she witnesses her friend&#39;s murder at the hands of what can only be an alien, thrusting her into a world that will kill to protect their secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunter stirs Serena&#39;s temper and her lust despite their differences. Soon he&#39;s doing the unthinkable breaking the rules he&#39;s lived by, going against the government to keep Serena safe. But are the aliens and the government the biggest threats to Serena&#39;s life...or is it Hunter?&lt;/p&gt;" />
