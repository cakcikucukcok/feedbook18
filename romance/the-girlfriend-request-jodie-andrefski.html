  <title>The Girlfriend Request - Jodie Andrefski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;This book had me swooning, laughing, and crying - a truly enjoyable read.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; -Brett Jonas, Goodreads Reviewer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emma has been best friends with Eli since she moved to his neighborhood ten years ago. Tired of being cast in the role of the girl next door, Emma creates a fake Facebook profile in the hopes of starting an online friendship with Eli, which would hopefully lead to more. Like...way more. From friend request to In a Relationship--it all seemed so completely logical when she&#39;d planned it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eli can&#39;t figure out what Emma is up to. He&#39;s pretty sure she&#39;s the one behind the Facebook profile, but then again, why would she do something so drastic instead of just admitting she wants to be more than friends? And who the heck is this new guy he saw her with? Eli starts to think that just maybe...he missed his chance with the girl next door.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two best friends, one outlandish ruse. Their status is about to become way more than It&#39;s Complicated...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer: This Entangled Teen Crush book contains one fake Facebook profile, two best friends who secretly crave each other, and a dreaded sex talk with parents...boy crush in the room included. Pushing a relationship beyond the friend zone has never been so crazy...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Girlfriend Request series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* The Girlfriend Request&lt;br&gt;* The Boyfriend Bid&lt;/p&gt;" />
