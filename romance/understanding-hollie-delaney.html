  <title>Understanding - Hollie Delaney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When asked, the Buyers Lawyer informed Victoria that a property would be acquired on the Island because his employer had family in the area. A reason Victoria had heard many times. Good enough. He neglected, however, to tell her that she was the family and the world she would enter was not hers.
Now the mental boxes Victoria used to separate the various elements of her life were getting soggy - beginning to leak all over her brain. As much as she tried; a piece of tape, a dab of glue, nothing was containing the spill.
From the Author of Meeting, Understanding takes the reader on a rollercoaster ride without an off switch as Victorias routine, self-created world irrevocably collapses around her.
Hollie Delaneys second novel continues to wrap her inside look at the real estate business with a provocative tale of Shaman, spirits, the paranormal and unforgiving sizzle." />
