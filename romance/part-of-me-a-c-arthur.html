  <title>Part of Me - A. C. Arthur</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shadow Shifters: Damaged Hearts&lt;/i&gt;-a deeply emotional, unforgettable New Adult paranormal romance series by A.C. Arthur about the men who are sworn to protect the females-human or otherwise-from the savage fury of his own nature...&lt;/b&gt; Lidia Morales has always felt out of place. The one stable presence in her childhood has always been Brayden. Every major moment, every growing pain, everything in her life has been shared with him since they were little, so it makes sense to her that they will stay friends at college together. Until one night, emotions are revealed in a heated kiss, and Lidia&#39;s world is turned upside down. Brayden has always been just a friend and she knows she should look somewhere else for love. But the memory of the passion between them is undeniable-and Brayden isn&#39;t about to let her forget it. As trouble brews, Lidia may need Brayden more than she realized and Brayden will do whatever it takes to convince her that they are soulmates...bonded for life, in&lt;i&gt; Part of Me &lt;/i&gt;by A.C. Arthur. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hunger for You &lt;/i&gt;coming June 10, 2014!  And don&#39;t miss &lt;i&gt;Mine to Claim, &lt;/i&gt;available now.&lt;/b&gt;" />
