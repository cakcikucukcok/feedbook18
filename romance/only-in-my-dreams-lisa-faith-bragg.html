  <title>Only In My Dreams - Lisa Faith Bragg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Only in My Dreams&quot; is the story of how a woman finds love just when she needs it the most. Beth&#39;s husband, Wayne, has been having an affair, but she is too embarrassed to discuss it, even with her friend, Chante. Beth blames herself for Wayne&#39;s infidelity. She has never truly loved Wayne. He has been a great father to her daughter, but for Beth, he is no more than a friend. An invitation from Chante is something Beth cannot resist-a whole summer vacation in New Jersey. That is when she meets Stephen, a musician whose band plays in one of the clubs in Sayreville. Beth is instantly smitten by Stephen and he feels the same way about her. But he is not the only one. Paul, Stephen&#39;s friend, is attracted to Beth as well. Torn between love and commitment, Beth is facing the hardest decision she has ever had to make. In the end, she knows she just needs to follow her heart.&quot;Only in My Dreams&quot; might appeal to readers who are interested in stories of romance and friendship." />
