  <title>Game Of Passions - Diana Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What happens when love knocks on your door without being invited?&lt;br/&gt;
More than 100,000 readers have read this saga&lt;br/&gt;
Lucas loves her but is more than tired of being just her lover. 
Carmen is not willing to give her heart to those who do not deserve it. 
He knows perfectly well that he is not a saint but the scoundrels also deserve an opportunity in love, do not they? 
Carmen, a young woman of our times; Determined, with character and plenty of feminine instinct, she knows how to recognize the rogues and their efficient bedroom games. The rogues never fall in love, she knows it perfectly. The best thing is to enjoy them for a short time, then flee very quickly and if I have seen you I do not remember. 
Lucas knows perfectly well that his days of conquest have ended but he must travel to Brazil and fight against an ebony god named Paulo, who, besides being handsome, is nice to rage.
He is a SWAT member, fun, intelligent and attractive to rage. What woman would not want to be more than her lover and become the reason of her days? 
romance, action and suspense, and a trip to Brazil, will make this story a game of passions, in which nothing is what it seems.
 &lt;br/&gt;
What to do when the heart dictates what reason rejects and passion dominates?&lt;br/&gt;
