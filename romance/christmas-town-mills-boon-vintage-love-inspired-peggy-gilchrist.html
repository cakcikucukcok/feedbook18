  <title>Christmas Town (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Love Inspired) - Peggy Gilchrist</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;&#39;TWAS WEEKS BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND ALL THROUGH THE TOWN…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Everyone was talking about the arrival of Jordan Scoville. The millionaire had been raised in Bethlehem, South Carolina, the town his family still owned. But Jordan hadn&#39;t been back in over ten years, and rumor had it that the savvy businessman had returned in order to close down their little &quot;Christmas Town&quot; forever!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But that didn&#39;t stop struggling single mother Joella Ratchford. Everyone she really cared about lived in Christmas Town. And she was convinced that all Jordan &quot;Scrooge&quot; Scoville really needed was faith. For surely the joys of the season would make him realize that it was up to him to save this town…and maybe find a happily ever after of his own.&lt;/p&gt;
