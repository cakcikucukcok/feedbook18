  <title>Lady of the Gulf - Kathy  Q Bruhl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the year 1900, Rebecca Rivers was on her way from Florida to Biloxi, Mississippi through the Gulf of Mexico.

A wave came over the bow, and before she knew what to do, she was swept overboard. She saw a light in the distance and fought the waves to get to the light. The waves carried her to the shore of an island, where she was found by the owner of the island estate, Beau LeGardier, a widower with a young child.
