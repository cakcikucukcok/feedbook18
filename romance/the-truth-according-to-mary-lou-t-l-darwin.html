  <title>The Truth According to Mary Lou - T. L. Darwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tony Dumas&#39;s life has been one marathon after another; he always finishes in just enough time before the next one begins, never seeming to get ahead. He feels a constant pull to grow up, acknowledge and accept responsibility, and settle into a career. He only has to let go of his past, accept his present circumstances, and fall in line to complete his journey toward adulthood, with the promised reward of security.   One morning, while Tony is hurrying to a job interview, he has a strange encounter with a homeless woman that alters his life forever. What follows is a series of events that leave him free-falling toward an uncertain future. An accident, followed by a long recovery period, sets Tony on a search for the truth about what actually occurred-and about the mysterious figure, who seems to have rearranged his life and demanded that he change himself for the better." />
