  <title>Her Secret, His Duty (Mills &amp; Boon Romantic Suspense) (The Adair Legacy, Book 1) - Carla Cassidy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;New York Times bestselling author Carla Cassidy writes about a scandal–and a passion–that could be front-page news…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Debra Prentice discovers she&#39;s pregnant, she knows two things are true: that she can&#39;t wait to become a mother…and that she can never reveal the father&#39;s identity to anyone. Because not only is Trey Winston her boss&#39;s son, he&#39;s also got his eye on the North Carolina senator&#39;s seat–and he doesn&#39;t need a scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But when Debra must work with Trey in organizing his fund-raising dinner, the sparks from their one night of passion still sizzle. Trey knows he should stay away from Debra, but it soon becomes impossible. And as Debra&#39;s life is threatened, Trey promises to keep her–and, unknowingly, the baby she carries–safe.&lt;/p&gt;
