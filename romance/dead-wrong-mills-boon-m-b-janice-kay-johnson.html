  <title>Dead Wrong (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Janice Kay Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A chilling blast from the past…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Six years ago prosecutor Will Patton&#39;s girlfriend stormed out on him. That night she was brutally raped and murdered. The violent act knocked Will&#39;s world out from under him, alienating him from his family, who Will believed were responsible. Wrapped up in his own guilt and anger, Will developed a powerful thirst for justice…and was determined that no criminal would ever walk free again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now he&#39;s returned to his hometown, but he is greeted by a gruesome discovery–another body and an all-too-familiar calling card. And once again the victim is romantically linked with Will. In order to track down this serial killer, Will teams up with rookie detective Trina Giallombardo–only to realize that if he falls for her, she&#39;ll be next….&lt;/p&gt;
