Hockey god. That&#39;s how everyone sees him now. But when they were teenagers, Zoey knew him as the kid who didn&#39;t have enough nerve to make a move on their one and only disastrous date. Seems he doesn&#39;t have that problem anymore, though. According to the rumors, he&#39;s with a different woman every night. After a rough divorce, the last thing Zoey needs is more heartbreak. But Jude&#39;s cocky, playful attitude is mighty hard to resist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Jude knows he isn&#39;t built for long-term relationships. But he&#39;s getting sick of women pounding on his door in the middle of the night looking for a rematch. When Zoey comes back into his life, it&#39;s like fate has given him a second chance. He&#39;ll do anything to make her happy again. Is this what love looks like? He has no idea. All he knows for sure is that this time, he&#39;s playing for keeps." />
