  <title>Dare You to Run - Dawn Ryder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dawn Ryder returns with &lt;i&gt;Dare You To Run, &lt;/i&gt;the second rapid-fire romance in her Unbroken Heroes series--featuring the tough, sexy men who serve in a top-secret Special Ops unit.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SERVE AND PROTECT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; For Vitus Hale, only one mission has ever gone wrong. All he had to do was rescue a beautiful woman from her kidnappers. But falling hard into bed--and into love--with the stunning innocent was not part of the game plan, and when she leaves him in the dust, Vitus has nothing but a blemished record and a hardened heart. Now, after three long years, his beauty has finally come back into his life--and this time, failure is not an option...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;SEDUCE AND DESTROY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; Damascus Ryland knew from their first steamy embrace that stoic warrior Vitus Hale is the only man for her, but when her power-hungry Congressman father offered her an ultimatum--sever ties with Vitus, or he dies--Damascus knew she had to walk away to save the man she loved.    But now, three years later, a new threat is closing in on her--and tossing Vitus right back into her life.  Damascus needs to keep her love for him locked in her heart if she is to keep him safe, but the old flame that burned between them is still as vibrant and hot as ever.  Now, Damascus and Vitus must risk it all to find their freedom...and embrace their love...&lt;/p&gt;" />
