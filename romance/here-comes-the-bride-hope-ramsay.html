      <meta name="description" content="For Professor Laurie Wilson, planning her wedding to longtime boyfriend Brandon Kopp has been a whirlwind. But somehow, between all the cake tastings and dress fittings, she never imagined being left at the altar. In the aftermath, she does what any sensible woman would - she swigs champagne and considers keying his car. Until someone knocks on her door with a much better idea for revenge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Best man Andrew Lyndon thinks Laurie&#39;s better off without Brandon. But Laurie&#39;s father - and Andrew&#39;s boss - isn&#39;t going to accept anything less than a reconciliation. And he&#39;s made it Andrew&#39;s problem to solve. So Andrew decides to make Brandon jealous by setting Laurie up on a string of &quot;dates.&quot; After a couple of weeks, Brandon will be begging Laurie to take him back. But Andrew&#39;s plan works a little too well because suddenly &lt;i&gt;he&#39;s&lt;/i&gt; the one falling for Laurie -- and planning a proposal of his own." />
