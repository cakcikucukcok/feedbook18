  <title>All Shook Up - Susan Andersen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Man With a Past&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When an unexpected inheritance sends J.D. Carver to the Star Lake Lodge to claim his half, he&amp;#39;s expecting trouble. Being greeted with open arms by the whole Lawrence gang&amp;#8212;feisty Aunt Sophie and calm Uncle Ben, clearly off-limits Dru and her young son, Tate&amp;#8212;just convinces him they&amp;#39;re working an angle, and he&amp;#39;s determined to uncover it. But a tiny part of him longs for the home-and-hearth life they have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Woman With a Reputation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dru&amp;#39;s finally beaten her bad-girl reputation, and though the Lodge may not be exciting, she&amp;#39;s fiercely protective of her quiet home. Hard-eyed J.D.&amp;#39;s ability to push all her buttons just proves how wrong he is for her. So why does her son hero-worship the guy? And why does her heart clench when he gets that &amp;#34;nose pressed against the candy shop window&amp;#34; look on his face?&lt;/p&gt;" />
