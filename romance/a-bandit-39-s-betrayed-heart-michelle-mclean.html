      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;North Carolina, 1866. &lt;/i&gt;Lucy Richardson may know how to sling a gun and pick a stubborn lock, but she doesn&#39;t have anything in her arsenal that would have prepared her for her first heartbreak. Her sisters taught her to fight like hell for what she wants... and she wants Finn. But he he&#39;s always pushed her away and she never understood why...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finn Taggart is bad news. His dark and tortured past always catches up to him, and Lucy deserves better than to be tainted by his touch. He couldn&#39;t have her seven years ago, and he can&#39;t have her now because being near him would only put her in harm&#39;s way. He couldn&#39;t prove his worth then but damned if he isn&#39;t going to try now and finally win the love they both have waited so long for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blood Blade Sisters Series Order:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; A Bandit&#39;s Stolen Heart&lt;br&gt; A Bandit&#39;s Broken Heart&lt;br&gt;A Bandit&#39;s Betrayed Heart&lt;/p&gt;" />
