  <title>On the Brink of Passion - Tamsen Parker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Snow and Ice Games where competition is not the only thing that is heating up! The fifth book in bestselling Tamsen Parker&#39;s romance series concludes with a pairs figure skating couple sharing the ice... and close quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the last Snow and Ice Games, Jubilee Buford and her husband and partner Stephen Wallace were on top of the pairs figure skating world. The newlyweds won gold and their future looked bright. But just months after she thought her world couldn&#39;t get any more perfect, Jubilee lost everything. After a scrapped attempt at a solo career, her coach found her a new partner and new possibilities in Beckett Hughes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beckett&#39;s had a hard time finding a partner to compete with. Someone who&#39;s as aggressive as he is, someone who&#39;s given up as much of their life as he has for success. He finally found a fit with Jubilee two years ago. She&#39;s not much fun to skate with, but Beckett doesn&#39;t need fun; he needs precision and effort and there Jubilee delivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a housing mix-up in the Snow and Ice village forces them to room with each other, they&#39;re suddenly compelled to recognize each other&#39;s human side. And as Jubilee and Beckett start to see each other as people instead of robots on skates, they discover that they&#39;ve got chemistry between the sheets as well as on the ice. But the flames between them in the bedroom might melt any chance they have at medaling, and that outcome is not acceptable to either one, or the country that&#39;s counting on them to bring home the gold and the glory.&lt;/p&gt;" />
