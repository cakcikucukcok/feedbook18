  <title>Macayla Marie Mone’ and the Dark Horseman - Gina M. Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Macayla, the daughter of a French aristocrat, is orphaned in the Arabian Desert, she turns to her friend Ahmed and his father for guidance. They take the beautiful young woman in and train her in the ways of their family, the Ground Warriors. Fierce and intelligent, Macayla quickly earns the respect of the people as she learns new customs and a new languageand soon word of the Woman Warrior spreads across the desert. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macayla and her adopted family are thrown into battle, fighting side by side for survival as their town is brutally attacked by marauders from the sands. After the battle, Macayla is taken to a tent village, where she attracts the romantic attention of two brothersthe Dark Horseman and his handsome brother, Kadier. There, instead of the refuge she seeks, she finds a love that is possibly more destructive than hate and is pitted against a mysterious, implacable enemy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dark Horseman takes his status as a tribal leader seriously, and he embarks on a lonely quest to find the marauders who are leaving a trail of blood across the Arabian sands. He has no time for love, but he finds himself racing down a road of anger and jealousy when he learns of his brothers passionate intensions to make the red-haired, violet-eyed Macayla his bride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can the Horseman put his own desires aside to serve his role as leader, or will his heart rule the day as surely as his sword rules the desert?&lt;/p&gt;" />
