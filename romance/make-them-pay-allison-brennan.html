  <title>Make Them Pay - Allison Brennan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In Allison Brennan&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Make Them Pay&lt;/i&gt;, Lucy Kincaid and Sean Rogan are finally tying the knot. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks before their wedding, a surprise visitor shows up at their door: Eden, Sean&#39;s estranged sister from Europe. She claims she&#39;s in town for the wedding and wants to mend fences. Lucy invites Eden to stay with them--after all, family is family--but her boss, SSA Noah Armstrong, knows far more about Eden&#39;s sketchy past than he&#39;s let on.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Lucy is focused on her investigation tracking down dozens of children sold through illegal adoptions, Noah begins a quiet investigation of Eden and her elusive twin, Liam. He&#39;s certain that, since they&#39;re both thieves, they&#39;re here for a job or a heist. But they are up to something far more sinister than even Noah can imagine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Liam has a score to settle with his family, and Sean has something he wants.  The twins will do anything to get it--including putting Lucy&#39;s life in danger.  It&#39;ll take everyone--Kincaids and Rogans alike--to stop Liam before someone dies. Unfortunately, Liam&#39;s treachery has unforeseen consequences for Sean and Lucy, as a longtime enemy of the Rogan family hellbent on revenge sees an opportunity to make them all pay...&lt;/p&gt;" />
