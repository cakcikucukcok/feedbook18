  <title>My Lettermen Years: the Journey to Hell and Back! - E. L. Scott, Jim Pike</title>
      <meta name="description" content="August 1961 was a month to remember for Jim Pike. That was the month his song The Way You Look Tonight hit the charts at number thirteen in the nation. From that moment on, Jim Pike and The Lettermen would be known around the world. Jim had everything going for him. Then, in 1975 and at the height of his fame, he lost his golden voice. For the next decade, he spoke only in whispers. 
He had to give up The Lettermen. 
For the next ten years, he struggled with the fear that he may never be able to sing again. But when, miraculously, he was reunited with his voice, he took it as a sign. Reunion, his new group, was born. After suffering for a decade, he overcame one of the biggest tragedies of his life. Losing his voice cost him much more than just his career, but when he got it back, he also regained a greater appreciation for his family, his life, and his music. 
Through it all, Jim realized that what seemed like a tragedy was really a blessing. In the process of finding his voice again, what he really found was himself." />
