  <title>The Close Encounters Man - Mark O&#39;Connell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The wildly entertaining and eye-opening biography of J. Allen Hynek, the astronomer who invented the concept of &quot;Close Encounters&quot; with alien life, inspired Steven Spielberg&amp;#8217;s blockbuster classic science fiction epic film and&amp;#160;is&amp;#160;the subject of History Channel&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Project Blue Book&lt;/em&gt;, and made an entire&amp;#160;nation want to believe in UFOs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 1947, private pilot Kenneth Arnold looked out his cockpit window and saw a group of nine silvery crescents weaving between the peaks of the Cascade Mountains at an estimated 1,200 miles an hour. The media, the military, and the scientific community&amp;#8212;led by J. Allen Hynek, an astronomer hired by the Air Force&amp;#8212;debunked this and many other Unidentified Flying Object sightings reported across the country. But after years of denials, Hynek made a shocking pronouncement: &lt;em&gt;UFOs are real.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty years after his death, Hynek&amp;#8217;s agonizing transformation from skepticism to true believer remains one of the great misunderstood stories of science. In this definitive biography, Mark O&#39;Connell reveals for the first time how Hynek&amp;#8217;s work both as a celebrated astronomer and as the U. S. Air Force&amp;#8217;s go-to UFO expert for nearly twenty years stretched the boundaries of modern science, laid the groundwork for acceptance of the possibility of UFOs, and was the basis of the hit film &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt;. With unprecedented access to Hynek&amp;#8217;s personal and professional files, O&amp;#8217;Connell smashes conventional wisdom to reveal the intriguing man and scientist beneath the legend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracing Hynek&amp;#8217;s career, O&#39;Connell examines Hynek&amp;#8217;s often-ignored work as a professional astronomer to create a complete portrait of a groundbreaking enthusiast who became an American cult icon and transformed the way we see our world and our universe.&lt;/p&gt;" />
