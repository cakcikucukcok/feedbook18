  <title>The Longest Trip Home - John Grogan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Meet the Grogans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before there was Marley, there was a gleefully mischievous boy navigating his way through the seismic social upheaval of the 1960s. On the one side were his loving but comically traditional parents, whose expectations were clear. On the other were his neighborhood pals and all the misdeeds that followed. The more young John tried to straddle these two worlds, the more spectacularly, and hilariously, he failed. Told with Grogan&#39;s trademark humor and affection, &lt;em&gt;The Longest Trip Home&lt;/em&gt; is the story of one son&#39;s journey into adulthood to claim his place in the world. It is a story of faith and reconciliation, breaking away and finding the way home again, and learning in the end that a family&#39;s love will triumph over its differences.&lt;/p&gt;" />
