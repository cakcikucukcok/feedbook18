  <title>In Search of Me - J.L. Stoenner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You are loved, probably more than you realize. God didn&#39;t make a mistake when He created you. He has a divine plan and purpose for you, but you won&#39;t be able to discover it or walk it out until you truly accept His unconditional, undying love for you made manifest through Jesus Christ. This book is the inspiring personal story of the first six years of a young woman&#39;s journey with Jesus, a journey of faith and discovery: faith in Christ and discovery of the wonderful, loving nature of God and her true God-given identity as a child of God and co-heir with Christ. She has made this journey into a devotional in hopes that it will help you, the reader, cultivate a deep, personal relationship with Jesus as well as help you discover your own God-given mission and successfully walk it out. As you read this inspiring story of faith and answer the questions at the end of each chapter, your relationship with God will grow deeper, and so will your faith. Get ready to dive deep into the very heart of God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
