  <title>Bonding with Piedmont - Victor D&#39;Amico</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Author Victor D&#39;Amico and his wife, Yvonne, are both of Italian heritage. Although Vic&#39;s parents did not maintain ties with their origins, Yvonne&#39;s and her parents were very close to relatives and friends from Piedmont, and her intimate knowledge of the language and customs of her parent&#39;s birthplace, adds a unique perspective to this exploration of the region&#39;s attractions.&lt;/P&gt;
Share with Vic his personal and rewarding experiences of connecting with the people, the land, the cuisine, and the history of a different culture. He introduces us to a region with rich traditions and natural attributes that are enjoyed by its people.&lt;/P&gt;
The story of the author&#39;s &lt;I&gt;Bonding with Piedmont&lt;/I&gt; covers over 50 years and gives a glimpse into a marriage and family as well as a window into people&#39;s behavior. You learn about Piedmont&#39;s history, its emergence as a leader in Italy&#39;s recovery from the war and mentally savor the area&#39;s splendid cuisine. When the author&#39;s son asks his parents to arrange his wedding near his grandmother&#39;s village, the bonding achieves new heights.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;I&gt;Bonding with Piedmont&lt;/I&gt; shows the author gaining an appreciation of his Italian heritage and reveals his conversion into a proud and knowledgeable proponent of a remarkable part of Italy with which few Americans are aware.&lt;/P&gt;" />
