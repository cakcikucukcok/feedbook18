  <title>Memories of a Fisherman&#39;s Wife - Alma Jean Irving</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story starts on the day Jean was born into a family of strife with an alcoholic father and parents that fought every weekend. She was raised with a sister and three brothers. The three oldest of the children were very close in age and did everything together as young children. The other two children came along later. So they were not as close as the older three were.
She went on to marry her first love at age fifteen. He was twenty. He drank a lot of beer so consequently there were a lot of problems. Over the years, he was unfaithful to her multiple of times. He was not yet ready to settle down. Yet they had three children to raise.
Roland was a commercial fisherman and times were hard. He would go out and get whatever seafood was in season to sell and bring some home to cook.
He spent lots of time away from home, sometimes two or three days. Sometimes he would be working, but most of the time, he was just goofing off or spending time with other people, and sometimes it would be with other women. Sometimes Jean would go out and find him and get him to come home.
Jean spent a lot of time cleaning the house and moving the furniture around from boredom. Other times, she would work outside the home. She tried to keep a stable home for the kids as best she could under the circumstances.
Sometimes Roland would take the children out on the boat, fishing and clamming. One time, there was an accident that occurred while he had the two boys out in the ocean on a small boat.
Roland escaped near death several times from events that happened while working in his fishing profession as a commercial fisherman.
What happened to him? And what happened to the girl in this story?
This is a story that never gets boring. It keeps your interest to the end." />
