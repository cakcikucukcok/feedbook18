  <title>And That&#39;s That! - Barbara Bush, Louise Suggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="AND THATS THAT! is the life story of one of golfs greatest champions. Louise Suggs shares a rich and colorful insight into the courage it took for her and a small group of women in the post WWII years to step out and build a womens professional sports organization - the Ladies Professional Golf Association. One of the LPGAs 13 Founders and one of the original Hall of Fame members, Louise Suggs began to make her name in golf with a dazzling amateur career, a dominant eight-year stretch during which she won every crown of significance in the womens game - many of them on multiple occasions. Louise went on to win 60 professional titles, a number bettered by only three other women in the 63-year history of the LPGA. She also triumphed in 11 major championships - an achievement bested by only two other women.
A Few Words About Louise Suggs
Louise deserves great credit for the work she did in making the LPGA a reality. She was a delight to play with. Her swing was a magnificent combination of fluid rhythm, balance and grace. She was an unselfish mentor to me, and Im honored to call her friend. - Mickey Wright, World Golf Hall of Fame Member
Louise is an inspiration and a role model for all women and girls to dream big and commit to making it happen - even in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges. Her remarkable life story is humble, heroic, and humorous, and demonstrates how much is possible when you are true to yourself and never lose sight of always doing the right thing. 
- Cindy Davis, President Nike Golf - Vice President Nike, Inc.
What is most impressive about Louise is her absolute humility in the face of such extraordinary accomplishments. What she has done throughout her life and career warrant a Paul Bunyan-sized ego, yet Louise exhibits nothing less than grace, dignity and an authentic spirit. While the LPGA is lucky to have Louise as a hero, I believe no one is more fortunate than the person who can call Louise a friend.- Ty Votaw, Executive Vice President - Chief Global Communications Officer PGA Tour
The LPGA wouldnt be even close to what it is today if it hadnt been for Louise and some of the other players of her era. Louise has always been a woman of integrity and conviction. This guided her through her life and that is what I have always loved about her. - Beth Daniel, World Golf Hall of Fame Member, 2009 U.S. Solheim Cup Captain
The goal for a life well lived should be the ability to leave your mark - on the people you met, the places you visited, and in the career you pursued. Suffice it to say that no one has left a more permanent mark than Louise Suggs. Because of the courage, vision, and perseverance of Louise and her fellow LPGA Founders, women all over the world can pursue their dreams in this wonderful game.
