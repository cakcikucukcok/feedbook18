  <title>In Their Own Words - the Final Chapter - James A. Oleson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nearly 100 illustrious fi ghter aces and test pilots have granted personal glimpses from their military careers to help create this tribute to Americas patriotic and heroic fliers.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
IN THEIR OWN WORDS - THE FINAL CHAPTER - TRUE STORIES FROM AMERICAN FIGHTER ACES illuminates what it took to fl y and survive in hostile enemy skies and to test our new and unforgiving fighter aircraft.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
When I f irst began compiling information, interviewing and corresponding with our legendary fighter pilots, there were about 600 of the original 1,473 fighter aces still with us.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
It is now 2011 and only 10% of our American fi ghter aces are still living. I, and other military aviation enthusiasts are indeed fortunate that this book will again honor and tell the fi rst person accounts of nearly 50% of these
remarkable remaining fi ghter pilots. Th e goal of this book is to write the fi nal chapter to this stunning legacy. 
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
A great deal of our nations rich military heritage is about to become extinct. In a very few years all our ace fi ghter pilots will be gone. Th e fact that our country is still free and speaking English instead of Japanese or German bears witness to
their extraordinary deeds and courage." />
