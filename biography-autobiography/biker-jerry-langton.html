  <title>Biker - Jerry Langton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Set in the a rust-belt city called Springfield, USA, &lt;em&gt;Biker&lt;/em&gt; traces the career trajectory of Ned &quot;Crash&quot; Aiken, a small-time high-school drug dealer who rises quickly through the ranks of a major biker gang. He sees the wisdom in migrating to the ranks of the Sons of Satan, a powerful OMG that is busy expanding their territory, either by patch-over or by killing the competition. Aiken proves himself a natural leader and in a few years is overseeing business involving millions of dollars and life-and-death decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through Aiken&#39;s rise to power, the inner sanctum of the outlaw motorcycle gang is revealed. The power structure; the operations; strategic decisions made around rival gangs; dealing with the weak and traitorous; colluding with native Americans and Canadians to smuggle guns, drugs, prostitutes and contraband into Canada. As the reader discovers, the OMG is not the romantic free-wheeling beer-fest world as portrayed by bikers, but a scummy existence that draws social outcasts like moths to a flame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biker&lt;/em&gt; is frank and realistic, conveying a brutal reality but one that continues to be sought after and idolized, and read about, because it is a world that continues to fascinate those on the outside looking in.&lt;/p&gt;" />
