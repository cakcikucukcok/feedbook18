  <title>Precious Honour - Rank Injustice - Brendon K. Colvert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A dramatic, gripping story told to finally reveal the truth after all these years. 
Irish Voice , New York
The voice of an innocent man is heard above prevailing agendas and Bungling Bureaucracy  Garda Review; Force magazine since 1923 
The tragic story of one of the founders of the Garda Sochna  Irish Independent, weekend. 
Officers Club celebrating the rise to justice of a gentleman of the Force once banished from its door, Garda Review. 
He had to struggle against a background of adversity that would have broken a lesser man  Emergency Services Ireland
William Geary was an intelligent, resourceful and successful policeman in 1920s Ireland. By 1928 he had also become a thorn in the side of the still active anti-Treaty IRA, so they contrived to besmirch Gearys good name and have him dismissed from the force. A coded message, which they knew would be intercepted by the (Gardai,) police was sent implying that Geary had accepted a bribe of 100 from the IRA for providing them with secret State information. 
Geary was confronted by Commissioner Eoin ODuffy, Chief Superintendent David Neligan and Deputy Commissioner Eamonn Coogan on 16 June 1928 and was summarily dismissed from the force on 25 June 1928 without any form of trial of a chance to reply to the charges against him. He spent the next seventy-one years clearing his name." />
