  <title>The Summer of &#39;89 - Jamella A. Jihad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Story of Brotherhood
New book tells the story of six black males and a friendship that extends beyond a lifetime.
True friendship and brotherhood can give meaning to ones life, even after a painful experience where good memories of a once strong bond are the only thing that is left. Such is the story of six men in Jamella A. Jihads The Summer of 89: A Summer to Remember, an inspirational story released through Xlibris.
In a society where color is an issue, equality is rare, and inferiority is a disease. This very situation led to the birth of a friendship among a group of African American males determined to help each other depart from the stigma that this society has about black males. Through each others support, all of them graduated with honors from one of the finest high schools in the state and have been accepted into prestigious colleges.
