  <title>The Adventures of Arthur Conan Doyle - Russell Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As the creator of Sherlock Holmes, &quot;the world&#39;s most famous man who never was,&quot; Arthur Conan Doyle remains one of our favorite writers; his work is read with affection--and sometimes obsession--the world over. Doctor, writer, spiritualist: his life was no less fascinating than his fiction.&lt;br&gt;            Conan Doyle grew up in relative poverty in Edinburgh, with the mental illness of his artistically gifted but alcoholic father casting a shadow over his early life. He struggled both as a young doctor and in his early attempts to sell short stories, having only limited success until Sherlock Holmes became a publishing phenomenon and propelled him to worldwide fame. &lt;br&gt;            While he enjoyed the celebrity Holmes brought him, he also felt that the stories damaged his literary reputation. Beyond his writing, Conan Doyle led a full life, participating in the Boer War, falling in love with another woman while his wife was dying of tuberculosis, campaigning against injustice, and converting to Spiritualism, a move that would bewilder his friends and fans.&lt;br&gt;            During his lifetime Conan Doyle wrote more than fifteen hundred letters to members of his family, most notably his mother, revealing his innermost thoughts, fears and hopes; and Russell Miller is the first biographer to have been granted unlimited access to Conan Doyle&#39;s private correspondence. &lt;i&gt;The Adventures of Arthur Conan Doyle&lt;/i&gt; also makes use of the writer&#39;s personal papers, unseen for many years, and is the first book to draw fully on the Richard Lancelyn Green archive, the world&#39;s most comprehensive collection of Conan Doyle material.&lt;br&gt;            Told with panache, &lt;i&gt;The Adventures of Arthur Conan Doyle&lt;/i&gt; is an unprecedentedly full portrait of an enduringly popular figure.&lt;/p&gt;" />
