  <title>Living Proof - Yvette Cabrera</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Living Proof is a real, insightful, honest, and yet, strongly informative story of how a young womans personal experiences through the U.S. public education system equipped her with the knowledge and tools that would unknowingly lead her later in life to recognize an issue of discrimination, resulting in the dissonance between the disabled and general populations. Where it has now lead her to embark on the road of sharing her story with YOU by writing this book to promote more awareness in regard to the lack of inclusiveness. From an early age, as she dealt with her physical disability, specifically visual impairment, she always had to adapt to each new situation as it came. For the most part, she remained to keep herself optimistic and live her life as ordinarily as possible. This book provides an original module that teaches and suggests how one can begin to bridge the gap, at any time, in reaching inclusiveness. It centers on the importance of self-advocacy through the importance of self-awareness. Foreseen as anything but ordinary to most, Living Proof gives way for individuals with and without disabilities to see how ones life is just as ordinary as another even if it may not seem like it. Currently as an entrepreneur, Ms. Cabrera is a dedicated disability consultant and life coach, compassionately bringing forth techniques and understanding to both the disabled and general populations in reaching inclusiveness on a personal and professional level." />
