  <title>Loving the Addict - Raven Storm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Loving The Addict&lt;/i&gt; is based on a true story.&lt;br /&gt;This story has everything from love , lust , hate, dominance, obsession, sex, police chases, drug lords, violence , abuse, deceit, betrayal and most of all survival.&lt;br /&gt;Know one understood the power that Jake controlled over my heart. A Spell some would say that could not be broken.&lt;br /&gt;An addiction I would say.&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning the motivation behind writing the book &lt;i&gt;Loving The Addict&lt;/i&gt; was a jotting down in a journal as self therapy to cope with what happened to me., and was used to help me deal with the abuse that had occurred in my life&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;Loving the Addict was an incredible read from beginning to end, not just because it is a page turner but because it is a true story about intense, compelling and emotional subject matter that morphs into a honest insight into survival and ultimately personal redemption. When I read the book I couldn&#39;t put it down. The story of Jake and Brenda has so many layers that it keeps you constantly guessing what the highs and lows are going to bring. The complexities of both characters and Brenda&#39;s personal points of view make for an amazing read but also a change of insight and perception of the core themes: love, addiction and domestic violence.&quot;
