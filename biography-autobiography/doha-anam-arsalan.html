  <title>Doha! - Anam Arsalan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;We NRIs are made to sweat in places that friends back home have no clue about.&quot; The portly colleague from IT department fittingly described her state...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his homeland, an expatriate is looked up in awe, with &#39;look how far he has gone&#39; or &#39;minting money abroad&#39; becoming clichd sentences. The reality, however, is much different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doha! Diary of a Delhi-O-holic is an honest portrayal of an expatriate&#39;s lifestyle in the Middle East, that is monotonous, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author, an expat himself, has flattened the overhyped word. The 16 short stories, written in an engaging and satirical style, are bound to captivate the heart and mind of the readers. In the Indian context, the word expat equates with those acronyms  &#39;NRI&#39; or &#39;PIO&#39;, that are considered hallowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memoir summarises the journey of the protagonist in a melting pot of cultures with oil, sports, cyberspace, and exchange rate thrown in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A must read for those, seeking that elusive adrenaline rush off the shelves. It will leave an indelible mark on your soul that yearns for an escape route from your mundane existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe, it&#39;s time you stop seeing the expats through rose-coloured glasses.&lt;/p&gt;" />
