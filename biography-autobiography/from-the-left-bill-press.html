  <title>From the Left - Bill Press</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;THE WASHINGTON POST BESTSELLER&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Bill Press has done it all. He was the Chair of the California Democratic Party, he has been involved in numerous campaigns, he has been a prolific writer, and has worked as a host and commentator on radio and TV. In other words, he knows politics inside and out. This is the tale of an engaged and often outraged citizen who loves his country and wants to see it move forward in a progressive direction.&quot; --Senator Bernie Sanders&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;A memoir of talk radio host and political commentator Bill Press.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name Bill Press is synonymous with honest journalism, intelligent commentary, and progressive politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But based on where he came from, it&#39;s a wonder he didn&#39;t end up a Trump voter. He grew up in a blue-collar family in a small town in Delaware south of the Mason-Dixon line, where segregation was the rule. As a Catholic, he was taught that abortion, divorce, sex outside of marriage, and homosexuality were morally wrong: beliefs later reinforced in ten years of seminary studies for the priesthood. He was on his way to be a rock-ribbed conservative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what went right for him that he swerved so far to the left? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;From the Left, &lt;/i&gt;Press shows this gradual transformation, starting with two years of studies in Europe and a providential escape to California. From Sacramento he made his way to Southern California television and talk radio as a political commentator and liberal talk show host. Jumping to Washington and national cable TV, Press hosted &lt;i&gt;Crossfire &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Spin Room &lt;/i&gt;on CNN, and &lt;i&gt;Buchanan and Press &lt;/i&gt;on MSNBC. A member of the White House Press Corps and columnist for Tribune Media Services and The Hill, Press was an early supporter of Bernie Sanders and hosted two of the Senator&#39;s first presidential strategy sessions in his living room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re already on the left, you&#39;ll cheer a fellow traveler. If not yet there, you soon will be.&lt;/p&gt;" />
