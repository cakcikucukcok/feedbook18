  <title>Silicone Injury - Hemitra Elan*tra Vedenetra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this memoir of courageous survival and endurance, author Hermitra Elan*tra Vedentra recounts her harrowing journey through Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Fibromyalgia, Connective Tissue Disease, Multiple Chemical Sensitivity and Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity, as a consequence of chemical poisoning from her silicone breast implants.
For her, breasts implants were supposed to be the solution to a problem. Instead a much bigger problem ensued, and she was sent careening down a precipice she never could have foreseen. Her body was destroyed by silicone and so was her life. Her task then became one of survival.
Her story begins in a small town in Italy, unfolds in New Jersey, New York City and Dallas, Texas and ends in the high mountain desert of Arizona, where she had to escape to save her life." />
