  <title>The Road to Rochelle - Harry X. Winfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Through the urging of a long-time best friend and fraternity brother, whose advice could not be ignored, a retired mechanical engineer endured eleven months of diligently focusing on task. 
By April of 2013, the elderly engineer had completed his projectthe submission of his memoirs to an author. As a happy husband of thirty-five years and soon-to-be grandfather, the choice of a writer of the elder engineers novel had been a beautiful young female professor. Even with two novels published, she was a nervous risk. Her father was a long-time acquaintance of the retired engineer and also a sitting circuit judge. 
Motivation for the retired engineers writing had been provided within a list of goals promised to himself decades earlier. 
Although having been occasionally prompted throughout his lifetime, the elderly engineers final motivation to tell the world of his past was provided by the rediscovery of one of the five woman he had ever truly loved. 
The details of the engineers memoirs required inclusion and complications within the intimacies of the engineers complex premarital-sex life." />
