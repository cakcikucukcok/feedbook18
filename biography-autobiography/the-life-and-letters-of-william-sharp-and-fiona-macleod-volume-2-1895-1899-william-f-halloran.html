  <title>The Life and Letters of William Sharp and &quot;Fiona Macleod&quot;. Volume 2: 1895-1899 - William F. Halloran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What an achievement! It is a major work. The letters taken together with the excellent introductory sections - so balanced and judicious and informative - what emerges is an amazing picture of William Sharp the man and the writer which explores just how fascinating a figure he is. Clearly a major reassessment is due and this book could make it happen.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;mdash;Andrew Hook, Emeritus Bradley Professor of English and American Literature, Glasgow University&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
William Sharp (1855-1905) conducted one of the most audacious literary deceptions of his or any time. Sharp was a Scottish poet, novelist, biographer and editor who in 1893 began to write critically and commercially successful books under the name Fiona Macleod. This was far more than just a pseudonym: he corresponded as Macleod, enlisting his sister to provide the handwriting and address, and for more than a decade &amp;quot;Fiona Macleod&amp;quot; duped not only the general public but such literary luminaries as William Butler Yeats and, in America, E. C. Stedman.&lt;br /&gt;
Sharp wrote &amp;quot;I feel another self within me now more than ever; it is as if I were possessed by a spirit who must speak out&amp;quot;. This three-volume collection brings together Sharp&amp;rsquo;s own correspondence &amp;ndash; a fascinating trove in its own right, by a Victorian man of letters who was on intimate terms with writers including Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Walter Pater, and George Meredith &amp;ndash; and the Fiona Macleod letters, which bring to life Sharp&amp;rsquo;s intriguing &amp;quot;second self&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With an introduction and detailed notes by William F. Halloran, this richly rewarding collection offers a wonderful insight into the literary landscape of the time, while also investigating a strange and underappreciated phenomenon of late-nineteenth-century English literature. It is essential for scholars of the period, and it is an illuminating read for anyone interested in authorship and identity.&lt;br /&gt;
