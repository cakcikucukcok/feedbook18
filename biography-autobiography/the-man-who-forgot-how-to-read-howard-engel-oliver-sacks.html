The letters had mysteriously jumbled themselves into something that looked like Cyrillic one moment and Korean the next. While he slept, Engel had experienced a stroke and now suffered from a rare condition called &lt;i&gt;alexia sine agraphia,&lt;/i&gt; meaning that while he could still write, he could no longer read.&lt;br&gt;            Over the next several weeks in hospital and in rehabilitation, Engel discovered that much more was affected than his ability to read.

At first geography eluded him: he would know that two streets met somewhere in the city, but he couldn&#39;t imagine where. Apples and grapefruit now looked the same. When he returned home, he had trouble remembering where things went and would routinely ?nd cans of tuna in the dishwasher and jars of pencils in the freezer. &lt;br&gt;           Despite his disabilities, Engel prepared to face his dilemma. He contacted renowned neurologist Dr. Oliver Sacks for advice and visited him in New York City, forging a lasting friendship. He bravely learned to read again.

It is a story that is not only as fascinating as one of his own detective novels, but a testament to the resilience and creative adaptation of one man and his brain.” ---Oliver Sacks<br /><b><i>The Man Who Forgot How to Read: A Memoir: Engel, Howard ...</i></b> | THE MAN WHO FORGOT HOW TO READ by Howard Engel is yet another treatise on the odd and confusing thing we call the brain. Having suffered a minor stroke while sleeping, novelist Engel discovered to his great dismay he could no longer read.<br /><b><i>The Man Who Forgot How To Read by Howard Engel</i></b> | Spare, thoughtful and upbeat, Engel illuminates the "insult" to the brain and the business of learning to live with it. He had help - a wide network of family and friends and a relationship with neurologist Dr. Oliver Sacks, who provided an afterword for Engel's post-stroke Cooperman book and supplies another for this memoir.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Man Who Forgot How to Read - Howard Engel, Oliver Sacks</a> </h3></p><hr/>
