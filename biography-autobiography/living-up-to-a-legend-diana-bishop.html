  <title>Living Up to a Legend - Diana Bishop</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Diana Bishop recounts growing up in the shadow of her famous grandfather, Canadian First World War flying ace Billy Bishop.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As a child, Diana Bishop showed up one day at school with a brown paper bag. Inside was a large breastplate of some of the most precious war medals on the planet, including the Victoria Cross. They belonged to Canada’s most celebrated First World War pilot, Billy Bishop, and until her family donated them to the Canadian War Museum, they had been kept in her father’s underwear drawer. That day at school was the first time Diana realized she was not growing up in an ordinary family.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Now, after more than two decades in Canadian media, Diana Bishop looks back on her grandfather’s legacy, and its profound influence over not only her life and her family’s life, but over the history of her country. &lt;i&gt;Living Up to a Legend&lt;/i&gt; is a unique memoir that covers not only Billy Bishop’s military career and personal life, but examines his legacy through the eyes of one of the people who it affected the most." />
