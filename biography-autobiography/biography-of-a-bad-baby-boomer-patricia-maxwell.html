  <title>Biography of a Bad Baby Boomer - Patricia Maxwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Throughout her life, author Patricia Maxwell has determined that unpleasant and heartbreaking episodes and the mistakes made during ones life builds character and helps develop empathy for those suffering similar circumstances. In &lt;i&gt;Biography of a Bad Boomer&lt;/i&gt;, she shares those experiences that have shaped her.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;From her birth in 1957 in Coffs Harbor, this memoir describes her personal journey through life in Australia from the fifties to the twenty-first century. She shares her struggles as a teenager with the lack of self-esteem, suffering through domestic abuse at the hands of her husband, returning to school for further education, living with Parkinsons disease, and being diagnosed with breast cancer. Maxwell narrates how her easy-going nature put her in odd and incongruous places as diverse as a sheep station, an R.AA.F Hercules Aircraft, and a sleazy bar in Cambodia.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;Biography of a Bad Boomer&lt;/i&gt; tells about the twists and turns in Maxwells life and the important lessons she has learned from all of them.&lt;/P&gt;" />
