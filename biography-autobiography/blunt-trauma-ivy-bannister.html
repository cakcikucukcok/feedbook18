  <title>Blunt Trauma - Ivy Bannister</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On September 2, 1998, a fire in the cockpit sent Swissair Flight 111 plunging into the sea off Peggy&amp;#39;s Cove, Nova Scotia. All 229 men, women and children on board perished, including Ivy Bannister&amp;#39;s sister, Patty. Set in Dublin, New York and the South Shore of Nova Scotia, &lt;i&gt;Blunt Trauma&lt;/i&gt; is the true story of how one family&amp;#39;s life was ravaged by the terrible event.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Ivy Bannister switched on BBC radio from her home in Dublin the following morning, she had no idea that that the first thing she&amp;#39;d hear would change her life forever. An ocean away from the tragedy that claimed her sister&amp;#39;s life, Ivy soon left her family to be with her 80-year-old mother in New York City. What follows is a poignant day-by-day account of how she coped with the tragic death of her sister, and the painful practicalities of identifying remains and disposing of possessions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blunt Trauma&lt;/i&gt; takes a powerful look at tragedy, grief and acceptance in an intimate, fast-paced, and sometimes startling story that shows the past as illuminated by the present and explores how catastrophe shatters imperfect familial relationships.&lt;/p&gt;" />
