  <title>The Devil And Bobby Hull - Gare Joyce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An award-winning writer sets the record straight on hockey&#39;s forgotten golden boy--Bobby Hull&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In his prime, few could dispute Bobby Hull&#39;s athletic brilliance--the first to have five 50-goal seasons, the highest scorer on the 1976 Canada Cup team, the first to use the slapshot as a scoring weapon, and the first hockey player to sign a million-dollar contract. With his body-builder torso, and his 100 mph volleys across a rink, the world of hockey glory was his to lose.  And he did. With his publicized marital troubles and his defection from the NHL to the WHA, Hull&#39;s star began to fall, leaving him broke and in exile from the game.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Devil and Bobby Hull&lt;/em&gt;, this once great hockey player and pioneer is finally given his due. Not only are Hull&#39;s remarkable on-ice achievements finally put in perspective, so, too, are his achievements off the rink--including endorsements for a wide array of products (rare for an NHL player) and his appearance on the cover of &lt;em&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/em&gt; a record four times. And the book details how Hull&#39;s battle with the owners of the Chicago Blackhawks--challenging the reserve clause in his contract, a move that enabled him to move to the WHA--helped other players follow him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A candid look at one of hockey&#39;s most gifted and controversial figures, &lt;em&gt;The Devil and Bobby Hull&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of his extraordinary career and life--and why this remarkable man has not faded into oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;" />
