  <title>My Side of the Story - Jessica D. Stafford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 2002, seven-year-old Jessica Stafford was a typical second-gradera girl with long, beautiful, brown hair, big, blue eyes, and lots of friends. She was just finishing the school year and was looking forward to a fun-filled summer. But for a few weeks, she had been experiencing severe headaches, and doctors discovered a tumor the size of a walnut at the base of her skull. She was diagnosed with medulloblastoma, a rare, malignant tumor that occurs in the cerebellum, the part of the brain that controls coordination, memory, and equilibrium. Thus began Jessicas journey through a cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In My Side of the Story, Jessica shares the narrative of how she and her family endured the battle with cancer, from the diagnosis to dangerous surgery to radiation and chemotherapy treatments. With diary entries included, Jessica reveals what it was like to be a young cancer victim. She also tells how she was the recipient of a wish from the national Make-A-Wish organization to Disney and how she was able to meet George Jones, her favorite country singer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now twenty years old, Jessica describes her hard-fought battle with cancer. She is evidence that miracles do happen, that God does exist, and he does answer prayers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
