  <title>Empowering Memories - Paule D. Bros</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Plato said that a life without criticism is not worth living. But what if the criticism is a lingering plague, an immutable fact among your fellow countrymen? The bitterness among my people and the constant bickering led me to travel to the motherland once or twice a year in search of stories powerful and compassionate enough to heal. 
Have I heard stories? Have I seen greatness? You bet. I have heard and seen Haitian doctors, nurses, parents, students, pastors, judges, and missionaries do brave and kind things more often than one could imagine. 
But the lack of wisdom among our people is outright blatant. 
Many of us fail to understand the power of collectivism, so we are unable to embrace it. Many of us are too entrenched in our individual lives to realize that individualism can lead to nothing but a hindrance of lasting sustaining peace and prosperity. 
May the story of this one peaceful Haitian politician inspire hope and encourage others to use their voices to tell their great stories that will in turn encourage openhearted empathy, thus allow our people to recognize their flaws yet understand and value their strengths. Only then will they be free to transform and soar. 
Try to be at peace with everyone  (Hebrews 12:14)." />
