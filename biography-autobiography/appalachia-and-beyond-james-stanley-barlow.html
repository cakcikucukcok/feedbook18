  <title>Appalachia and Beyond - James Stanley Barlow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Appalachia and Beyond:Yarns and Yearnings in Prose and Poetry,   Stanley Barlow entertains us with some stories and sketches--many of them from Appalachia as he experienced it growing up. He engages us in some thinking about education, religion, and personal identity. Here too are some poems--new and selected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The yarns and sketches are for the most part true. Some come from my humorist years, writes the author.  The play, Mostly Anecdotal, I hope  reads like a short story: it centers on  a colorful professor in Oregon, and at the same time, it argues the importance of career counseling in our schools and colleges.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Much of the narrative in the book reflects my years  as an educator  in Tennessee, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, and  New York.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This book also includes some deep thoughts lets say, jottings that are pensivehence I call them Pensees--that are like Wagnerian chords seeking resolution. They are for conversation.  So also, are some of the 
eighty-one poems.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In Appalachia and Beyond, you will find the following:-- 
In Part One:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Twelve humorous stories and collectionsthe author calls them: Yarns--- that will tickle your funny bone,
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
and
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Fourteen sketches/groups of sketches that highlight unique  personalities.   
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In Part Two:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
An original play: Mostly Anecdotal, features a certain colorful teacher named Jewell, and focuses on career counseling. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In Part Three:
Twelve Pensees: Thoughts for conversationfrom the authors essays,  notes and journalsdiscuss religious beliefs, personal identity questions, and the joys of poetic reverie.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In Part Four:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Forty-three new poems, under headings: 9/11, Devotions, Looking Back, 
Love Notes, and  Questions

In Part Five:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
