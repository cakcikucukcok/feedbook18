  <title>Stetson, Pipe and Boots - Colorado&#39;s Cattleman Governor - R.L. Preston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book is a biography about Dan Thornton, a highly successful and well known purebred beef cattle producer (1937-1953) and an effective, flamboyant but controversial Colorado Governor (1951-1955).  From humble beginnings as the son of sharecroppers in West Texas, to president of the Texas 4-H Clubs at age 16, to the sale of two Hereford bulls for a world record price ($50,000 each) at the 1945 National Western Stock Show in Denver, CO, to a record Hereford sale in 1947, to winning the Governorship of Colorado as a last minute replacement candidate at 39 years of age, to being largely responsible for the location of the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado, Dan Thornton&#39;s story is an interesting and exciting adventure.  He was a friend with unknowns and celebrities alike, including Dwight Eisenhower, Bob Hope, Randolph Scott, Lauritz Melchior and Ben Hogan.  He campaigned early for Eisenhower for U.S. President.  He was Colorado&#39;s super salesman from cherries, beef, uranium, and coal to interstate highways and tourism.  His grave marker in Gunnison, CO is inscribed with the tribute, &quot;A Man Who Matched Our Mountains.&quot;" />
