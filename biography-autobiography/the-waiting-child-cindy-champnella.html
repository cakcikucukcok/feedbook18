  <title>The Waiting Child - Cindy Champnella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The inspiring true story of a four-year-old Chinese orphan who convinces her adoptive American family to return to China to rescue the little boy she couldn&#39;t forget&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adopted by an American family at age four, Jaclyn traveled to her new home with a great burden. Her new family had to leave behind a little boy who had been under her charge at the Chinese orphanage where Jaclyn fought the odds against abandonment, institutionalization, and hunger---not for herself, but on behalf of this even smaller child, whom she regarded as her responsibility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaclyn&#39;s saga spans oceans and cultures. &lt;i&gt;The Waiting Child &lt;/i&gt;is an extraordinary story of human resilience in the face of profound loss and suffering---and a testament to the ability of a loving heart to prevail over great adversity. Jaclyn&#39;s unshakable determination to bring to her new life the child she had cared for in the institution, the one she believed with all her heart was &quot;her baby,&quot; will change all assumptions made about the human spirit. In the end, this moving story affirms everything that is good and hopeful in life, when, after a two-year effort, the little boy is brought to this country as the adopted son of Jaclyn&#39;s American aunt and uncle.&lt;/p&gt;" />
