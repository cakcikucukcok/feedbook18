  <title>Unforgettable - Scott Simon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&#39;m getting a life&#39;s lesson about grace from my mother in the ICU. &lt;br&gt;We never stop learning from our mothers, do we?&quot;  &lt;br&gt;UNFORGETTABLE is a son&#39;s spirited, affecting, and inspiring tribute to his remarkable mother and the love between parent and child. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When NPR&#39;s Scott Simon began tweeting from his mother&#39;s hospital room in July 2013, he didn&#39;t know that his missives would soon spread well beyond his 1.2 million Twitter followers. Squeezing the magnitude of his final days with her into 140-character updates, Simon&#39;s evocative and moving meditations spread virally. Over the course of a few days, Simon chronicled his mother&#39;s death and reminisced about her life, revealing her humor and strength, and celebrating familial love. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNFORGETTABLE, expands on those famous tweets to create a memoir that is rich, deeply affecting, heart-wrenching, and exhilarating. His mother was a glamorous woman of the Mad Men-era; she worked in nightclubs, modeled, dated mobsters and movie stars, and was a brave single parent to young Scott Simon. Spending their last days together in a hospital ICU, mother and son reflect on their lifetime&#39;s worth of memories, recounting stories laced with humor and exemplifying resilience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNFORGETTABLE is not only one man&#39;s rich and moving tribute to his mother&#39;s colorful life and graceful death, it is also a powerful portrayal of the universal bond between mother and child.&lt;/p&gt;" />
