  <title>When God Stepped In - Bill Fisher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After a devastating car accident that killed his wife, Yvonne, and left author Bill Fisher severely wounded, he realized that this time, his life had just been spared from death for the ninth time. In &lt;i&gt;When God Stepped In&lt;/i&gt;, Fisher shares how his life has been punctuated with a series of miraculous acts of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this memoir, he narrates a series of encounters that have confirmed his faith in the power of God including healings, rescues, protection, shield, and provision. Fisher tells how God has allowed him to get into many unexpected, dangerous situations throughout his life and then has rescued him in often spectacular ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;When God Stepped In&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would seem almost impossible for all of these incidents to have taken place in the life of one man. However, I have known the author for many years, and they did!
John Barkman, Pastor, Missionary, Christian Missionary Alliance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A must-read, especially if you have any doubt that God heals today. The personal stories Bill tells of Gods involvement in his lifehealing, rescuing, restoringclearly demonstrate that God cares about every part of your life. Bill is very honest about his own life and failings, which is refreshing.
Mike Evans, Founder, Director, Wholeness Ministries&lt;/p&gt;
