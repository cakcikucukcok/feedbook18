  <title>Globalization and Some of Its Contents - George Rosen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was born in Russia in 1920, and came with my mother to the United States in 1923 after my Father had died. My mother had a brother and sister here.
	I was brought up and educated in Bridgeport, Coan; and Brooklyn, New York and got my Ph.D. at Princeton. My study area is Economics especially economic development in Asia and international trade. I have taught Economics at BARD College and the University of Illinois at Chicago. Between those two academics I worked with the U.S. State Department, the UN, the Ford Foundation, the MIT Center for Intl. Studies, RAND Corporation and the Asian Development Bank carrying out research teaching and providing policy advice on economic issues for the U.S. and for various Asian countries. I have lived and worked in India, Nepal, China, Japan, the Philippines, Thailand, and Indonesia and have written eight books on political economic issues in those countries, as well as one book on Chicago decision-making. My autobiography both describes and examines my life and attitudes over those years. I could never have done this if I had not immigrated here, and I think not only I but the U.S. and the world benefited by my being allowed to come here. I could not have done that in Russia over the past 50 odd years." />
