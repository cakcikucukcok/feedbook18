  <title>The Great Simon - Don Curtis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Simon de Montfort was a medieval leader of supreme ability and character. He came to England as a twenty-one-year-old who was recently knighted in France.  He possessed a deed for an estate.
Twenty-one-year-old king Henry accepted this title and befriended De Montfort.  Soon he became his brother-in-law as he married Princess Eleanor.  
The issues of the thirteenth century were divine right of kings versus council participation.  De Montfort, over time, became the leader of councils and tried to remain true to his feudal oath.  These struggles occurred for over twenty-five years.  Simon won it all, after a year and a half of being prime minister.  He was killed in a foolish battle. 
This story is about the Great Charter, Magna Carta, and the eternal fight between the haves and the have-nots." />
