  <title>Sea and Shore Stories, and the Nuclear Boogeyman - Ebe Chandler McCabe Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ebe McCabes book opens during the Great Depression. During World War II, dissatisfaction with urban life caused his father to return to his rural hometown with his young family. From there Ebe fulfilled a dream of his parents by attending the Naval Academy, where he learned the Duty, honor, country maxim. After graduation, he served on a destroyer, two fleet submarines, two nuclear powered fleet ballistic submarines, and the Atlantic Submarine Force Commanders staff. That included deployments to the Mediterranean and to the Western Pacific, and seven Polaris submarine patrols. After his active naval duty, he served in the Navy Reserve.
Ebes civilian career began with a nuclear power plant supplier subsidiarys nuclear controls engineering section. That was followed by over twenty years as a federal regulator of civilian nuclear power, including response to the Three Mile Island nuclear accident. Part Four of his book presents his personal assessment of nuclear war and nuclear power, with a primary basis being his naval and civilian experience and training.
Besides his career, Ebes book addresses controversies like the Kent State tragedy, war, marriage, immigration, capitalism vs. socialism, equality, and religion." />
