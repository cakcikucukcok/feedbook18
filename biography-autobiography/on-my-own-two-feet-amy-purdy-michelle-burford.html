  <title>On My Own Two Feet - Amy Purdy, Michelle Burford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Amy Purdy, who inspired a nation on &lt;em&gt;Dancing with the Stars&lt;/em&gt; and has been called a hero by Oprah Winfrey, reveals the intimate details of her triumphant comeback from the brink of death to making history as a Paralympic snowboarder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this poignant and uplifting memoir, &lt;em&gt;Dancing With the Stars&lt;/em&gt; sensation Amy Purdy reveals the story of how losing her legs led her to find a spiritual path. When the Las Vegas native was just nineteen, she contracted bacterial meningitis and was given less than a two percent chance of survival. In a near-death experience, she saw three figures who told her: &amp;#8220;You can come with us, or you can stay. No matter what happens in your life, it&amp;#8217;s all going to make sense in the end.&amp;#8221; In that moment, Amy chose to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her glimpse of the afterlife&amp;#8212;coupled with a mysterious premonition she&amp;#8217;d had a month before &amp;#8212;became the defining experiences that put Amy&amp;#8217;s life on a new trajectory after her legs had to be amputated. She wouldn&amp;#8217;t just beat meningitis and walk again; she would go on to create a life filled with bold adventures, big dreams, and boundless vitality&amp;#8212;and share that spirit with the world. In 2014, Amy&amp;#8212;the only competitor, male or female, with two prosthetic legs&amp;#8212;claimed a bronze medal for the U.S. Paralympic team in adaptive snowboarding. She then became a contestant on season eighteen of &lt;em&gt;Dancing With the Stars&lt;/em&gt;, and viewers were captivated as the girl with bionic legs managed to out-dance her competitors all the way to the finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy&amp;#8217;s journey is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the capacity we all have to dream bigger, defy expectations, and rewrite our stories. Amy was given a second chance for a reason&amp;#8212;to use her life to inspire others. Her powerful memoir urges us to live life to the fullest, because we are all a lot more capable than we could ever imagine.&lt;/p&gt;" />
