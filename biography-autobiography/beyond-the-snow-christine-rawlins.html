  <title>Beyond the Snow - Christine Rawlins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a much-needed study of a remarkable life. Elizabeth Goudge was not only a sensitive and acute artist in fiction, but a profoundly insightful commentator on the processes of growing up spiritually and morally. She fully deserves the kind of sympathetic and appreciative exploration provided by this book.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rowan Williams, 104th Archbishop of Canterbury&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Goudge once said she had done no exciting things - none of the wonderful things that some people do. Yet her achievement was wonderful. From the stuff of her own life  even the hard things like depression and nervous breakdown, even the Christian faith that upheld her throughout  she created best-selling books that were read, worldwide, throughout the forty years of her career and are still being read today. J.K. Rowling has said that her favourite childhood book was The Little White Horse - recently filmed as The Secret of Moonacre.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Snow is an appreciation of Miss Goudges life and work that attempts to look beyond her memoires, by linking them to her books and letters and the recollections of family and friends. It examines in particular her Christian faith and its illuminating influence on everything she did, and was. As Alan Walton said, reviewing The Joy of the Snow  there is nobody like her.&lt;/p&gt;" />
