  <title>Rude - Katie Hopkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Love her or hate her, Katie Hopkins is impossible to ignore, and this hilarious and revealing new book - part memoir, part handbook for the modern woman - is the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughing through the chapters of her life, she shares her disasters, her biggest disappointments and the time she had to ring her super sensible boss to say she was on the front pages of the tabloids having sex in a field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From being kicked out of the army for being epileptic, to firing little Lord Sugar; from her first husband leaving her in the maternity ward for the big-boobed secretary, to the reality behind &lt;i&gt;Celebrity Big Brother&lt;/i&gt;, she has plenty of surprises to share and lessons she thinks we should learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Readers be warned, however. Katie doesn&#39;t sugar-coat anything, and neither does she hold back, making her as honest in her book as she is in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this book is an introduction to a quieter Katie too, one people seldom see. She takes us beyond her front door and into the privacy of her home, writing as a mum of three, sharing things even she feels awkward saying.&lt;/p&gt;" />
