  <title>The Wink of an Eye - Volume Ii - H. Peter Hoffman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After he lost his wife to Alzheimers, author H. Peter Hoffman knew he lost a big part of his life. But he found a new meaning and a new reason to look forward to each day when he unearthed letters sent to him by his then girlfriend, Doris. In this release, the author captures his and his beloved wifes story through more letters and photographs. Included in this volume are letters written between1943 and 1946. It covers his wifes illness with Alzheimers spanning from 2002 to 2009. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When my wife passed away. I had totally forgotten the content of the letters, and now they were adding emotion and enjoyment to my life. Each evening, I look forward to retiring to my den and reading some of her letters. What a wonderful legacy she left me with! When she wrote those letters, she couldnt possibly have known how much enjoyment I would get from them over sixty-five years after they were written. I have read them more times than you can count on your fingers. The letters gave me a new feeling about my memoir. It is really more of a true love story than a memoir. The letters reminded me of what a wonderful person Doris was and how strong our love was, Hoffman shares. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
From first page to the last, The Wink of an Eye  Volume II will fascinate readers with a true love story lasting over six decades." />
