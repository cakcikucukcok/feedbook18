  <title>Space Traveler - James Vincent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="James Vincent is a &quot;world class&quot; musician.  That he is not a household name is entirely by his choice, yet almost all who have seen him perform or heard his recordings have become his fans.  He has written a unique, brutally honest account of his life  his childhood and discovery of the guitar; his going on the road at seventeen to play in seedy dives and military service clubs;  later, in famous upscale clubs across the country; then making records and playing huge concert venues.  James gives us an inside look at the recording industry  the studios, the performers, producers and promoters.  He gives us behind the scenes insights into many famous personalities  names like Santana, Garcia, Harrison and Cetera, and acknowledges some unsung heroes in the music world.  His cast of characters includes the very rich and the down and out, the saint and the prostitute, the famous, the infamous and the very bizarre.  This is a story about learning the hard way; about dysfunctional families, choices and consequences, lust, infidelity, despair, triumph, tragedy, friendship and betrayal.  Most of all, it is a life&#39;s journey to discover the meaning of unconditional love and spiritual fulfillment.  It is indeed, an odyssey.              ?R.J.M." />
