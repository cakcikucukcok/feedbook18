  <title>Sex and Shopping: The Confessions of a Nice Jewish Girl - Judith Krantz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dear Reader, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I was about to start my eleventh novel, I abruptly realized that I was making a huge mistake. On the verge of launching into the imagined world of a twenty-eight-year-old, I felt an intense need to tell another story, the story of a woman I know through and through...a woman with more wealth of experience, a woman who&#39;s seen more real glamour, known more fascinating people, lived in a world of more sophistication, and arrived at more hard-won maturity than that twenty-eight-year-old could hope for---in short, my own story. I&#39;ve tried to remain as unknowable as possible, the better to let my heroines hold the stage, but now I was ready to tell the truth about myself, with no holding back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I&#39;ve had a different life from that of the majority of women of my generation and background. While I seemed like another &quot;nice Jewish girl,&quot; underneath that convenient cover I&#39;d traveled my own, inner-directed path and had many a spicy and secret adventure. I grew up in a complicated tangle of privilege, family problems, and tormented teenaged sexuality. After a riotous education at Wellesley, my life was turned upside down by a glorious year in Paris, marked by an intense but ill-starred romance. I spent the next half-decade in New York, sowing lighthearted wild oats until I finally met my true love, to whom I&#39;ve been married for forty-six years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I was fifty I had an utterly unexpected, almost unbelievable success as a number-one bestselling novelist that has continued for book after book. Challenging, lucky, exciting, and often devastatingly askew, my life seems to have been lived under a wild and antic star.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve had as much amazing fun as my heroines, and here&#39;s the book to prove it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Judith Krantz&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
