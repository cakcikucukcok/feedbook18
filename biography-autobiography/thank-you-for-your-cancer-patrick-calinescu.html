      <meta name="description" content="Thank You for Your Cancer is the story of my life, a 40-year old man born with a condition called arthrogryposis, and of my fight against ingrained prejudice in society toward the disabled. It is also the story of my parents&#39; cancer; first, my mother&#39;s cancer, who died of it in 2005, and now also my father&#39;s cancer, whose disease has triggered in me an existential quest for some explanations as to why all of this is happening to me, which I have tried to systematize in this book. But my memoir is also a story of success: my intellectual triumph over my physically miserable body has been made possible by my humanities formal education and my never-ending love for philosophy." />
