  <title>Body-Line? - Harold Larwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="(Author&#39;s Preface)&lt;br /&gt;I should like to state at the beginning of my book that what is stated in it on controversial matters is my own firm opinion, except where in a few cases the views of other people are published and their names given.&lt;br /&gt;I wish to make it clear that though there were, and are, sharp differences of opinion on the subject of Fast-Leg-Theory bowling between myself and some Australians, there was always an atmosphere of complete cordiality between the teams on both sides. Although we differ seriously over my Fast-Leg-Theory bowling I have done my best in the following pages not to disturb that atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;Until now my side of the matter has not been heard. I have refused many tempting offers to break silence. As a fast bowler and a hitter by nature I have written strongly because I cannot express myself otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;I hope very much indeed that in doing so, though I was one, of the aggrieved parties in Australia, I have given nobody half the offence from which I suffered so often on the last tour.&lt;br /&gt;A belief exists that some of the things I have written about are not yet to be discussed.&lt;br /&gt;Obviously I differ from that view. I do so because I feel that in a matter of such vital interest to cricketers as the possible admission by legislation of such a far-reaching principle as that bowlers may not bowl as they like, no cricketer can keep silent. I believe I have only written here what very many cricketers are saying. But I have written supported by first-hand knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;For the many imperfections of style and language in my first book I beg the indulgence of my reader.&lt;br /&gt;Yours Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;H. Larwood" />
