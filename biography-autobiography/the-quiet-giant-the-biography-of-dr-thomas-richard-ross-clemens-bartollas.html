  <title>The Quiet Giant: The Biography of Dr. Thomas Richard Ross - Clemens Bartollas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Quiet Giant: The Biography of Dr. Thomas Richard Ross is both an autobiography and biography. Chapters 2 through 5 were written by Dr. Ross and were sent to me to be part of this biography. Chapter 1 and 6 through 13 were written by me, but they were greatly shaped by interview statements sent by former students, colleagues, and friends of Dr. Ross. I was able to interview two-thirds of those who had majored in history from 1949, the first year that Dr. Ross taught at Davis and Elkins College to when he retired in 1983. What is so fascinating about these statements is how much commonality there is with those of us who were fortunate to be his students. Dr. Thomas Richard Ross was a great man, a great teacher, a great human being, and a great Christian. He touched so many people." />
