  <title>Barryisms - Barry McAlister</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After a ways I could see a huge boat mostly buried in the sand, while examining the boat it seemed to have been a cabin cruiser about 65 feet long. Then walking about 100 feet south of the boat I was stunned to find a human body, not something you see every day. The person was mostly a skeleton although hair was evident on his head; jeans and shirt were tattered and the skull looking toward the sky where I could see some primitive dental work. 
After a couple more frightening traverses, while hanging in space, I thought we had passed the most difficult situations, wrong again! We came to a place where youre climbing along the cliff face with no more than 4 inches of rock on which to place your feet. That accelerated my heartbeat a tad! 
While hiking on a narrow dike I came face to face with a Bison almost blocking my passage. As I walked past he charged me. I yelled Stop That! and he stopped about 2 feet away. 
Few people have a desire or capability to experience the edge. For most of my life I professed, To experience life as close to the edge as possible to death, as this is the only way to live a life to its fullest. 
Being up here, among 12,000 foot peaks, in the enchanting time before sunrise, will always remain as a consummate memory in my mind. I was filled with a delightful wonderment. Then there came the serene Alpine Glow as the sun embraced the mountain peaks. As John Muir would say, A noble experience. 
The sun would occasionally pop out, followed by dark clouds and usually hail or sleet. I didnt care; I was wet; in a numbing trance and reduced to taking baby steps forward-one step at a time. Around 6 pm I reached the road, which was back down at 10,000 feet. I had only traveled 8  miles, but on the most difficult trek of my life. 
We had chased the Gator near shore; I jumped from the boat in knee deep mud; struggling through the mud I grabbed the Gator with my left hand and immediately he came around and imbedded his teeth in my right arm. Just as quickly he let go and I loaded him into the boat. Mostly I was concerned with infection, but a little Rum in the holes took care of that." />
