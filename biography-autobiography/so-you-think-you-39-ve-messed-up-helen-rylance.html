  <title>So You Think You&#39;ve Messed Up - Helen Rylance</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book draws back the curtain on the authors life and lets in the light of God&#39;s grace which is always sufficient for us whatever we are facing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When God gave Helen a vision, it was at one of the lowest points of her life. She was excited as the vision revealed something of the future God had planned for her. When she shared the vision with some friends they laughed at her. &quot; Why would God give you a ministry and a house?&quot; They asked. At that time her self esteem was very low, so Helen agreed with them. Why would the Lord give her a big house and a husband as well as a ministry? This only happened to special people and she wasn&#39;t one of those, were her thoughts. She was a nobody, with little or no future! They were right. So she laid the vision down believing it to be impossible, but Helen reckoned without God, a fatal mistake!
When two months later the Lord spoke into her life, telling her to pick the vision up again. She was delighted. This time she took hold of it with both hands, and determined that she would not let go of it again, no matter what it cost her. Little did she know it would almost cost her, her life!&lt;/p&gt;" />
