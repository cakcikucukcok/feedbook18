  <title>Sister Parish - Susan Bartlett Crater, Apple Parish Bartlett, Albert Hadley, Bunny Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sister&amp;#8212;as she was always called by family and friends&amp;#8212;was born Dorothy May Kinnicutt into a patrician New York family in 1910 and spent her privileged early life at the right schools, yacht clubs, and coming-out parties. Compelled to work during the lean years of the Depression, Sister combined her innate design ability with her upper-echelon social connections to create an extraordinarily successful interior decorating business. The Parish-Hadley firm&amp;#8217;s list of clients reads like an American Who&amp;#8217;s Who, starting with Astors, Kennedys, Paleys, Rockefellers, and Whitneys. She helped Jacqueline Kennedy transform the White House from a fusty hodge-podge into a historically authentic symbol of American elegance. For her clients, she was an indispensable presence, both in their salons and designing them. Sister&amp;#8217;s style, marked by cozy, airy, colorful, but understated elegance, came to be known as &quot;American country,&quot; and its influence continues to this day. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Compiled by Apple Parish Bartlett (one of Sister&amp;#8217;s daughters) and Susan Bartlett Crater (a granddaughter) from Sister&amp;#8217;s own unpublished memoirs, as well as from hundreds of interviews with family members, friends, staff, world-renowned interior designers (Mark Hampton, Mario Buatta, Keith Irvine, Bunny Williams, and her long-time partner Albert Hadley, among many others), and clients (Annette de la Renta, Glenn Bernbaum, Mrs. Thomas Watson, et al.), &lt;I&gt;Sister Parish &lt;/I&gt;takes the reader right into the houses&amp;#8212;and the lives&amp;#8212;of some of the most fascinating and famous people of this inimitable woman&amp;#8217;s time. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Long out of print, this acclaimed biography&amp;#8212;a &lt;I&gt;New York Times &lt;/I&gt;Notable Book&amp;#8212;of the doyenne of American interior design is once again available to acquaint a whole new generation of designers and design lovers with the charismatic woman who redefined interior design in America. Fully updated, the revised edition features a new Foreword by Albert Hadley and an Appreciation by Bunny Williams, who began her career at Parish-Hadley.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;A &lt;/B&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;New York Times&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;B&gt; Notable Book&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Praise for Sister Parish:&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&quot;Sister Parish&amp;#8217;s reminiscences, along with those of her friends and admirers, bear a remarkable resemblance to what one remembers about her interior decorating&amp;#8212;warm, personable, cozy, thoughtful, harmonious, satisfying, impeccable.
