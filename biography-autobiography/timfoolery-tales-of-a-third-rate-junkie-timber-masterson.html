  <title>Timfoolery: Tales of a Third-Rate Junkie - Timber Masterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Masterson is a great and ridiculous writer. He has a singular voice, one that always shocks me and makes me laugh. It&amp;#39;s shocking he&amp;#39;s not a huge writer, won&amp;#39;t be a surprise if he becomes one.&amp;quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;James Frey &lt;/strong&gt;- Author of A Million Little Pieces, My Friend Leonard, Bright Shiny Morning and Endgame: The Calling. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Spurning the usual gloom and doom of the addiction-recovery genre, &lt;strong&gt;TIMFOOLERY&lt;/strong&gt; vibrates with a manic and surreal energy and an astonishing facility with language, pushing it into the realm of narrative&amp;#39;s most extreme and playful possibilities. Part Odyssey, part Fear and Loathing, this is a modern day voyage into the heart of darkness, of isolation, a Gen-X coming-of-age tale while shaking it rough on the mean streets.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Timber Masterson&amp;#39;s stories dance madly along the line between truth and fiction, fun and addiction, trouble and affliction. His voice is unique, insistent and impossible to ignore. The man is a force to be reckoned with.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Shaughnessy Bishop-Stall&lt;/strong&gt; - author of Down to This: Squalor and Splendor in a Big-City Shanty Town and Ghosted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The book tells the story of a decade that embraces the ennui of being broke and homeless in Los Angeles, jetting in and out of clinics and treatment centers, shelters, and AA meetings. This Outsider is at odds with dealers, doctors with agendas, priests handing out redemption, creepy casting directors, and teachers with lessons too hard to learn. We encounter children at the door wanting only candy, getting more than they bargained for, enfeebled and enraged landlords and complex girlfriends-turned-escorts and Kafkaesque rabbits that rescue.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Tim Masterson is a writer first and a junkie second (or third according to the title - I&amp;#39;m not sure what he does in between). As such, he manages to capture the absurdity of addiction from the perspective of an astute observer while simultaneously exposing the frenetic and often-insane thought process used to justify active addiction. Through Tim&amp;#39;s incredible gifts as a writer we get to see how absurdly funny addiction can be even when there is no fun being had.&amp;quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oran Canfield&lt;/strong&gt; - Author of Long Past Stopping.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;An addict with a life-saving charm, the protagonist pulls scams, crashes social events, and impersonates employees - whatever it takes to impress, to ingratiate and to get the next fix. His refuge is the interior world of drug-induced fantasies poised on the precipice of a fall into real memory and the imminent loss and waste, the spectral accompaniment to the addled life of addiction; a phantasmagoria of layered symbolism and imagery in the production of a unique vision somewhere this side of reality.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;In an age when some of our greatest creative geniuses - Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Robin Williams, amongst others - have succumbed to addiction, depression and their darker side, it is fascinating to pierce the mind of a talented young man with an impressive skill set with devils of his own. His writings provide insight into the creative mind and the challenges both internal and external that confront it.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Michael A. Levine&lt;/strong&gt; - Chairman - Westwood Creative Artists&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These meditations in the tradition of Coleridge unfold in a theater of the absurd, forging&amp;nbsp; a kind of William Burroughs situation-comedy-of-club-kids, driven through the narrator&amp;#39;s world to a place where the reader wonders if it&amp;#39;s truly happening in the present or is a wished for kaleidoscopic dream state.&lt;/p&gt;" />
