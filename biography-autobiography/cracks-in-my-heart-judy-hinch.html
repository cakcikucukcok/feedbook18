  <title>Cracks in My Heart - Judy Hinch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1975, just after experiencing a divorce, author Judy Hinch was looking for something to occupy her days. At the same time, the fire department in Aberdeen, Maryland, amended its bylaws to allow women to join its ranks. Her decision to become a recruit altered her life in many ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Cracks in My Heart, she shares her story of serving more than forty years as a firefighter, EMT, and paramedic. Hinch offers insight into the lives of men and women emergency first responders who witness mind-numbing ugly things, horrid human behavior, and rarely a kind act or beautiful ending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From fires to train accidents to suicides and disorderly activities, Cracks in My Heart details some of the events and adventures Hinch experienced while serving her town as a volunteer. She discusses the sacrifices, the tragedies, the rewards, and the people she met on duty, describing why she often gave her heart to strangers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
