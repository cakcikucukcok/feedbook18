  <title>Dear Pussycat - Helen Gurley Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dear Pussycat:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of us find it easier to say in a letter whatever it is we want to express -- love, rage, outrage, affection, resentment, enthusiasm, a request to do a chore -- than we do person to person or even phone to phone.  I&#39;ve been writing letters, somewhat successfully I think, since I was eight years old.  I got President Franklin Roosevelt to write to my wheelchair-bound (from polio) sister by dropping him a line at the White House. Some of my letters don&#39;t quite make it, of course -- trying to get &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; publisher Arthur Sulzberger to fire his vicious play reviewer Frank Rich who tore apart my husband&#39;s perfectly fine play, A Few Good Men. He wouldn&#39;t do it -- no recourse but to write the reviewer himself, &quot;Dear Frank, you bastard! etc.&quot; I&#39;ve thanked designer Emilio Pucci for turning small bust and big hips into goddess stature with whammo fabric and genius engineering, kept a few beloved employees from jumping ship or into the river with careful flattery, consoled the grieving.  Wouldn&#39;t you like to see a little collection of my best, meanest and happiest notes that reflect a pretty fascinating New York life, a career they don&#39;t make many like, love and friendship with junior high school buddies and a few razzle-dazzle celebrities? Okay...if you like good old-fashioned staying-in-touch by correspondence, here they are!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helen Gurley Brown&lt;/p&gt;" />
