  <title>Hemingway and Bimini - Ashley Oliphant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Follow Ernest Hemingway’s exploits on the Bahamian island of Bimini from 1935 to 1937, the very moment in time when the International Game Fish Association (under the author’s co-leadership) was emerging. Covers Hemingway’s role in the formation of the IGFA, his underappreciated seminal writing about competitive saltwater angling when the sport was still in its infancy, the amazing fishing he enjoyed on the island, and the way all of these experiences translated into the composition of his posthumous novel &lt;i&gt;Islands in the Stream&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the only book on this period in Hemingway’s life and reveals unexpected dimensions to the Hemingway portrait that deserve attention, including his surprising humor, his advanced conservationist views several decades before the environmental movement even began, and his egalitarian ideas about his contemporary female counterparts in the big-game fishing world—challenging the usual portrait of Hemingway as a chauvinist with no personal rules, boundaries, or conscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Includes beautiful vintage photographs of 1930s Bimini that have never been published in book form.&lt;/p&gt;" />
