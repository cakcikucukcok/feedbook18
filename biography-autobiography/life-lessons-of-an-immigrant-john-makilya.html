  <title>Life Lessons of an Immigrant - John Makilya</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;John Makilya reveals an in-depth look of Kenya, its people, and its traditions in this memoir about growing up there and starting a family before immigrating to the United States of America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He traces his roots, including how his father became a pioneer educator and was selected to lead a Kenyan delegation on a pilgrimage to Rome during the 1950 Catholic Jubilee. Upon his return to Kenya, he acquired land for the establishment of a Catholic church and later ventured into parliamentary politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makilya also recalls his own career in various sectors, including savings and credit cooperatives, ranching and the beef industry, sustainable community-owned water projects, horticultural production and marketing, community-owned fishing enterprises, and wildlife conservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In doing so, he shares an intimate account of his work as a consultant making socioeconomic assessments of the World Bankfunded El Nio Emergency Project, his role in the enterprise development component of a USAID COBRA project, and his work as chairman of the board of governors of the Misyani Girls Schoolwhere he insisted girls were as talented in math and science as boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join the author on an inspiring journey from Kenya to the United States in Life Lessons of an Immigrant.&lt;/p&gt;" />
