  <title>Be Free or Die: The Amazing Story of Robert Smalls&#39; Escape from Slavery to Union Hero - Cate Lineberry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;***Finalist for the Gilder Lehrman Lincoln Prize***&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Henry Louis Gates, Jr: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A stunning tale of a little-known figure in history.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Candice Millard: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Be Free or Die&lt;/i&gt; makes you want to stand up and cheer.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The astonishing true story of Robert Smalls&#39; amazing journey from slave to Union hero and ultimately United States Congressman.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a mild May morning in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1862, the second year of the Civil War, when a twenty-three-year-old slave named Robert Smalls did the unthinkable and boldly seized a Confederate steamer. With his wife and two young children hidden on board, Smalls and a small crew ran a gauntlet of heavily armed fortifications in Charleston Harbor and delivered the valuable vessel and the massive guns it carried to nearby Union forces. To be unsuccessful was a death sentence for all. Smalls&#39; courageous and ingenious act freed him and his family from slavery and immediately made him a Union hero while simultaneously challenging much of the country&#39;s view of what African Americans were willing to do to gain their freedom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After his escape, Smalls served in numerous naval campaigns off Charleston as a civilian boat pilot and eventually became the first black captain of an Army ship. In a particularly poignant moment Smalls even bought the home that he and his mother had once served in as house slaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cate Lineberry&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Be Free or Die&lt;/i&gt; is a compelling narrative that illuminates Robert Smalls&#39; amazing journey from slave to Union hero and ultimately United States Congressman. This captivating tale of a valuable figure in American history gives fascinating insight into the country&#39;s first efforts to help newly freed slaves while also illustrating the many struggles and achievements of African Americans during the Civil War.&lt;/p&gt;" />
