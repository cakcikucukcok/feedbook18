  <title>Puttin&#39; on Airs - Benton L. Bradberry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Horatio Alger wrote wildly popular dime novels in the mid to late 1800s about poor boys
making good. The theme was always the same; that through honesty, hard work, strong determination,and perseverance, the American Dream could be realized regardless of his beginnings in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puttin on Airs is the authors own story of himself as a poor boy who made good against the odds, a story which could have been written by Horatio Alger. The author describes his life
growing up in rural Louisiana as one often children of uneducated parents, under conditions of spirit crushing poverty. He escaped this life by joining the Navy at age 17. Within 5 years time he became an offi cer and aviator and went on to complete a 21 year Navy career. In time he obtained a university degree (with honors), the only member of his family to even attend college. Only 2 of the 10 children even graduated from high school, himself and a sister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join the Navy and see the world, the recruiting poster said, and see the world, he did. He has been on 6 continents and in over 40 countries. He was also on the front line of the Cold War from near its beginning to near its end, which included a year in Viet Nam as a helicopter pilot. As a helicopter pilot, he also helped retrieve the astronauts from the sea after their return to earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the same determination and grit that propelled him in his Navy career, he entered private business after retiring from the Navy, which has made him a wealthy man. This well written book should be an inspiration to anyone who enjoys a good rags to riches story.&lt;/p&gt;" />
