  <title>My Word is My Bond - Sir Roger Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; One of the most recognizable big-screen stars of the past half-century, Sir Roger Moore played the role of James Bond longer than any other actor. Beginning with the classic &lt;em&gt;Live and Let Die&lt;/em&gt;, running through &lt;em&gt;Moonraker&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A View to a Kill&lt;/em&gt;, Moore brought his finely honed wit and wry charm to one of Hollywood&#39;s most beloved and long-lasting characters. Still, James Bond was only one in a lifetime of roles stretching back to Hollywood&#39;s studio era, and encompassing stardom in theater and television on both sides of the Atlantic. From &lt;em&gt;The Saint to Maverick&lt;/em&gt;, Warner Brothers to MGM, Hollywood to London to extreme locations the world over, Roger Moore&#39;s story is one of the last of the classic Hollywood lives as yet untold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now. From the dying days of the studio system and the birth of television, to the quips of No&amp;#235;l Coward and David Niven, to the bedroom scenes and outtakes from the Bond movies, Moore has seen and heard it all. Nothing is left out&amp;#8212;especially the naughty bits. The &quot;special effects&quot; by which James Bond unzipped a dress with a magnet; the spectacular risks in &lt;em&gt;The Spy Who Loved Me&#39;s&lt;/em&gt; opening scene; and Moore&#39;s preparation for facing down villains (he would imagine they all have halitosis): the stories in &lt;em&gt;My Word is My Bond&lt;/em&gt; are priceless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout his career, Moore hobnobbed with the glamorous and powerful, counting Elizabeth Taylor, Jane Seymour, and Cary Grant among his contemporaries and friends. Included are stories of a foul-mouthed Milton Berle, a surly Richard Burton, and a kindhearted Richard Kiel, infamous as Bond enemy Jaws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much as it is Moore&#39;s own exceptional story, &lt;em&gt;My Word is My Bond&lt;/em&gt; is a treasure trove of Hollywood history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
