  <title>The Happy Hooker: My Own Story - Xaviera Hollander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;How did &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; first learn about sex? If you grew up in the 1970s, it may have been from a gleefully lusty tour guide named Xaviera Hollander&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;In the late 1960s -- that era of sexual chaos, when Playboy Clubs and love-ins were competing for national attention -- a beautiful, intelligent young Dutch secretary named Xaviera de Vries moved to New York, grew swiftly tired of her desk job . . . and soon became the most visible and glamorous madam the city had ever seen. As Xaviera Hollander, she published a shockingly candid account of her life behind the brothel door. &lt;em&gt;The Happy Hooker&lt;/em&gt; shot straight to the top of the bestseller lists, sold more than fifteen million copies, and made this enterprising young woman an international phenomenon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Thirty years later, these delightfully explicit tales of the &#39;60s and &#39;70s swingers&#39; scene -- including countless jaw-dropping stories of lesbianism, bondage, fetishism, and more -- remain as titillating as ever, charged with the mix of shrewd observation and uninhibited appetite that made Hollander an irresistible storyteller. &lt;em&gt;The Happy Hooker&lt;/em&gt; is a classic: the world&#39;s greatest book on the world&#39;s oldest profession.&lt;/p&gt;" />
