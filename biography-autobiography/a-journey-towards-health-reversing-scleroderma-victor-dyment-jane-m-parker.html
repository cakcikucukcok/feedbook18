  <title>A Journey Towards Health É Reversing Scleroderma - Victor Dyment, Jane M. Parker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Answers do exist for seemingly incurable diseases. The information contained in this book applies to a diverse variety of conditions ranging from ADD, Autism, Scleroderma, and MS to psoriasis and eczema. We all have the ability to reach good health by changing to the correct materials such as dental, clothing and furniture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book follows Jane Parker&#39;s journey from the diagnosis of systemic Scleroderma, a fatal autoimmune disease, to good health. After a year of unanswered questions, numerous doctors and alternative practitioners, she finally received a correct diagnosis of Scleroderma. In researching the disease she found there was no known way to cure it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All existing information held no hope for survival  and definitely none for a reversal, but this didn&#39;t stop her search to cure this deadly disease. She tried many different approaches, from conventional medicine to alternative therapies with no apparent results or answers to her problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She finally found the answer through Victor Dyment, a Russian healer/scientist who has been doing research into the effects of different materials on health. Victor found the answers that can help reverse many diseases, not only Scleroderma. Under Victor&#39;s guidance she is the first one who has completely reversed this irreversible condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book describes the many steps Jane took, including the failures as well as the triumphs, in her struggle to overcome this deadly disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book follows Victor&#39;s research from its beginnings in Russia to the development of his Health Frequency theory and the effects of materials on our health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the increasing awareness of environmental health hazards this book is vital for both children and adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By sharing these experiences and knowledge, we want to make your journey to health a lot shorter than Jane&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;
