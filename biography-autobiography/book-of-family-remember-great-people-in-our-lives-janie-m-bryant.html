&lt;p class=&quot;Default&quot;&gt;Wild West Adventures in the Great African Bush&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Default&quot;&gt;by &lt;strong&gt;David Robert Dalton &lt;/strong&gt;(with contributions by Mike, Trevor &amp; Garth Dalton)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Default&quot;&gt;Embark on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wild West Adventures in the Great African Bush &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;with author David Robert Dalton, who takes you to the African bush in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Inspired by his and his brothers fond memories of growing up in the little copper mining town of Messina (now called Musina) in South Africa, with written contributions from his three elder brothers, he pens a wacky, side-splitting tale of his adventures growing up in the little bushveld town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Default&quot;&gt;Set in the African bushveld (a.k.a. the Great Arizona Desert), the three elder Dalton cowpokes are members of a gang dubbed the Messina Dalton Gang, after the infamous Wild West Dalton Gang, who roar around on their two-wheeler steeds and talk in tough Western jargon. The youngest Dalton cowpoke, six-year-old, David, calls himself Gunslinger and his main ambition in life is to become a recognized member of the gang. Together with his little African Pawnee sidekick-&lt;em&gt;hombre&lt;/em&gt;, Tokoloshie-Two-Feathers, and his three-legged Jack Russell dog, Jock, Gunslinger tries hard to impress, but continually messes up. The story, told in a light-hearted tongue-in-cheek fashion, as told through the fertile imagination of a six-year-old boy, but is written for adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Default&quot;&gt;Theres a delightful array of wacky small-town characters that help the story come alive, making you feel part of it. Theres the delicious Danish Tart, who runs the Mine Rec Club bar, Speedy, the towns beefy Harley-riding policeman, Paparazzo, the long-nosed Italian crime reporter, Frank&amp;Earnest (the same person!), the hip Holy father, the disapproving &lt;em&gt;Dominee, &lt;/em&gt;Mrs Bogey, the Mine Managers snooty wife, and the gangs all-suffering parents, the Old Man and Daisy-Anne, who all contribute to the hilarity! Dredging up ones own childhood memories, its a wonderful nostalgic tale to touch the hearts of all ages!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Default&quot;&gt;Its so darned funny; itll have you laughing out loud! A charming and endearing must-read story for all ages! I simple loved it!  Brenda George, author of &lt;em&gt;Falling Leaves and Mountain Ashes. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Default&quot;&gt;I warmed to this delightful and endearing book  a unique African TO-KILL-A-MOCKINGBIRD look into the mind of a child of those nostalgic times.  Gloria Keverne, international bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;A Man Cannot Cry &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Broken Arrow&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Default&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Available in &lt;em&gt;EBook &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;paperback &lt;/em&gt;format, see: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
