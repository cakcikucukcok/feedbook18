  <title>Baby Don&#39;t Hurt Me - Travis Thrasher, Chris Kattan, Seth Meyers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;You may know him as Mango, Mr. Peepers, the gibberish-spouting Suel Forrester or one half of the Butabi brothers. Maybe you remember him as the Gothic high schooler Azrael Abyss, Gay Hitler, or the guitarist in the Cowbell Sketch. Whichever it is, Chris Kattan has earned a spot in the hearts of a generation of &lt;EM&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/EM&gt; fans. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Whether channeling characters, delivering unforgettable impersonations like his outlandish Al Pacino, or head-bopping at the Roxbury, Chris Kattan has defied all comparison, expectations, and sometimes gravity, bringing his incomparable style of physical comedy, the likes of which have rarely been seen on &lt;EM&gt;SNL&lt;/EM&gt;.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now, for the first time ever, Kattan opens up about his years being on &lt;EM&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/EM&gt;, performing alongside friends and future legends including Will Ferrell, Jimmy Fallon, Amy Poehler and Tina Fey, along with sharing about his fascinating and unusual childhood and his time hanging out backstage watching Pee-Wee Herman and the late Phil Hartman on The Groundlings stage. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But mostly, Kattan shares seven seasons’ worth of hilarious, and never-before told stories from his wild ride through &lt;EM&gt;SNL&lt;/EM&gt;. From a hysterical and somewhat dark occupation driving a widowed 92-year-old Dutch millionaire on Mulholland Dr. (and her giant poodle Rex), to breaking his neck (literally!) while performing on live television, he chronicles the ups and downs of life in search of the spotlight, and pulls back the curtain on the inner workings of two of comedy’s greatest institutions.?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Provocative and personal, goofy and heartfelt, &lt;EM&gt;Baby, Don’t Hurt Me&lt;/EM&gt; is a window into the world of millennium-era &lt;EM&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/EM&gt;, from the rehearsals to the after-after parties, as narrated by your funniest, wised up, weirdest friend—who just so happened to be there for all of it!    &lt;/DIV&gt;" />
