  <title>On Wheels - Michael Holroyd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;A Book of Secrets&lt;/i&gt;, a brisk, charming, illustrated account of a motoring life&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a child, Michael Holroyd spent his best hours in his family&#39;s cramped garage, which contained a wealth of magical, exciting objects. But the most intriguing by far was the one in the middle of the room--the family&#39;s eight-horsepower black Ford, which had found in the garage a permanent home and in Holroyd a dedicated caretaker. Sitting in the backseat--his own private castle--he began his love affair with the automobile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;     On Wheels&lt;/i&gt; is the story of the cars and drivers that inspired and affected Holroyd throughout his life. Ranging from drives around the country with his father, a car obsessive, to the baroque horrors of his austere driving instructor, to the liberating pleasures of automatic transmission, &lt;i&gt;On Wheels&lt;/i&gt; is an automotive autobiography--the story of times and places that mattered to the author, told through the cars that bore witness.&lt;br&gt;     &quot;My biographies,&quot; Holroyd writes, &quot;became increasingly filled with motoring exploits--something of which I was unaware until recently,&quot; and so &lt;i&gt;On Wheels&lt;/i&gt; is also a reflection on the author&#39;s many brilliant biographical subjects--Bernard Shaw, Lytton Strachey, and many others--and their own relationships to the open road.&lt;br&gt;     Casually intimate and often riotously funny, &lt;i&gt;On Wheels&lt;/i&gt; is a master biographer&#39;s miniature self-portrait--and an indelible reflection on his great passion.&lt;/p&gt;" />
