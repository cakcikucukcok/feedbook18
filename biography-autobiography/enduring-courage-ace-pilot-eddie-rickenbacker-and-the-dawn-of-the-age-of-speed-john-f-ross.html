  <title>Enduring Courage: Ace Pilot Eddie Rickenbacker and the Dawn of the Age of Speed - John F. Ross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The sensational true story of Eddie Rickenbacker, America&#39;s greatest flying ace&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the turn of the twentieth century two new technologies--the car and airplane--took the nation&#39;s imagination by storm as they burst, like comets, into American life. The brave souls that leaped into these dangerous contraptions and pushed them to unexplored extremes became new American heroes: the race car driver and the flying ace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No individual did more to create and intensify these raw new roles than the tall, gangly Eddie Rickenbacker, who defied death over and over with such courage and pluck that a generation of Americans came to know his face better than the president&#39;s. The son of poor, German-speaking Swiss immigrants in Columbus, Ohio, Rickenbacker overcame the specter of his father&#39;s violent death, a debilitating handicap, and, later, accusations of being a German spy, to become the American military ace of aces in World War I and a Medal of Honor recipient. He and his high-spirited, all-too-short-lived pilot comrades, created a new kind of aviation warfare, as they pushed their machines to the edge of destruction--and often over it--without parachutes, radios, or radar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Enduring Courage&lt;/i&gt; is the electrifying story of the beginning of America&#39;s love affair with speed--and how one man above all the rest showed a nation the way forward. No simple daredevil, he was an innovator on the racetrack, a skilled aerial dualist and squadron commander, and founder of Eastern Air Lines. Decades after his heroics against the Red Baron&#39;s Flying Circus, he again showed a war-weary nation what it took to survive against nearly insurmountable odds when he and seven others endured a harrowing three-week ordeal adrift without food or water in the Pacific during World War II. &lt;br&gt;For the first time, &lt;i&gt;Enduring Courage&lt;/i&gt; peels back the layers of hero to reveal the man himself. With impeccable research and a gripping narrative, John F. Ross tells the unforgettable story of a man who pushed the limits of speed, endurance and courage and emerged as an American legend.&lt;/p&gt;" />
