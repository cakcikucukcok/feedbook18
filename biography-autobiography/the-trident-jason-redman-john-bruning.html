  <title>The Trident - Jason Redman, John Bruning</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navy SEAL and author of &lt;em&gt;Overcome&lt;/em&gt; Jason Redman&amp;#8217;s highly-charged account of his combat missions in Iraq and his miraculous recovery from wounds that might have killed him&amp;#8212;if it were not for his grit and the devotion of his wife and family&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Decorated Navy SEAL Lieutenant Jason Redman served his country in Columbia, Peru, Afghanistan and Iraq, where he commanded mobility and assault forces. In western Iraq alone, he conducted over forty capture-kill missions with his men, successfully locating more than 120 Al Qaida insurgents. In September 2007, while leading a mission against a key senior Al Qaida commander, his team was ambushed and he was critically wounded by machine-gun fire at point blank range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the intense recovery that followed&amp;#8212;a years-long process that included 37 surgeries&amp;#8212;Redman gained national media attention when he posted a sign on his door at Bethesda Naval Medical Center, warning all who entered not to &amp;#8220;feel sorry for my wounds.&amp;#8221; Redman&amp;#8217;s sign became both a statement and a symbol for wounded warriors everywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Trident&lt;/em&gt; is an unforgettable story of one man&amp;#8217;s determination to overcome adversity. Redman recounts his story, from his grueling SEAL training to how he found the balance between arrogance and humility all while fighting America&amp;#8217;s enemies on far flung battlefields. He speaks candidly of the grit that helped him carry on despite grievous wounds, and of the extraordinary love and devotion of his wife, Erica, and family, without whom he would not have survived.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vivid and powerful, emotionally resonant and illuminating, filled with sixteen pages of photos, &lt;em&gt;The Trident &lt;/em&gt;traces the evolution of a modern warrior, husband, and father&amp;#8212;a man who has come to embody the never-say-die spirit that defines America&amp;#8217;s elite fighting force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
