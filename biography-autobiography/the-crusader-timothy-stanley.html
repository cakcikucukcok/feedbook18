  <title>The Crusader - Timothy Stanley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Crusader &lt;/i&gt;tells the fascinating life story of Pat Buchanan, the three-time presidential candidate, Nixon confidant, White House communications director during Iran-Contra, pundit, and bestselling author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buchanan is one of America&#39;s most controversial conservative rebels. After serving Nixon and Reagan, he led a revolt against the Republican establishment that was a forerunner for the Tea Party. In 1992 he tried to take away his party&#39;s nomination from the incumbent president, George H. W. Bush. Although he lost, Buchanan set the tone for political debate for the next two decades when he declared a &quot;cultural war&quot; against liberalism and a jihad on Republican moderates. Throughout the 1990s, his radical, rollicking presidential campaigns tore apart the GOP and articulated the hopes and fears of a new generation of Middle American conservatives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This balanced, and often funny, biography explores the highs and lows of Buchanan&#39;s career, from his stunning victory in the 1996 New Hampshire primary to his humiliating &quot;grudge match&quot; against Donald Trump in the 2000 Reform Party contest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its heart is a man who embodies the contradictions of the conservative movement: a wealthy bookworm who branded himself as an everyman reactionary, a Republican insider who became a populist outsider, a patriarch whose campaigns were directed by his sister, a socially unacceptable ideologue who won the affection of liberals and conservatives alike--Rachel Maddow, Ralph Nader, Eugene McCarthy, Ron Paul, even Mel Gibson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timothy Stanley tells the intimate story of the man who defined the culture war for a generation of Americans with outrage and wit; the man who, when asked what he thought about gun control, replied, &quot;I think it&#39;s important to have a steady aim.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
