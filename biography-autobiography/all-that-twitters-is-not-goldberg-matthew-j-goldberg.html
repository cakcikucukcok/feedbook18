  <title>All That Twitters Is Not Goldberg - Matthew J. Goldberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The real-life adventures of your average left-of-center, sports-crazed, technophobic, irreverent yet sentimental humor writer come to life within the pages of All That Twitters Is Not Goldberg. An almost fifty year-old (how the heck did that happen?) first-time father who tries to find meaning in everything from supermarket signs to presidential politics to the purgatory of being a Philly sports fan and weekend athlete, Matt strikes a blow for truth, justice and irreverence on his adventures, which include: 
 Ensuring that a local supermarket provides Guest Services, as advertised 
 Pondering the unlimited potential of selling ice cream to Eskimos 
 Flushing In Flushing during a Chinese New Years family dinner gone bad 
 Consulting a fictitious psychologist about his sports addiction 
 Preparing himself to author his first tweet 
Matthew J. Goldbergauthor of the brand new Wordapodia, Volume One is a uniquely dynamic writer and speaker noted for his irreverent, offbeat sense of humor. All That Twitters Is Not Goldberg is a compendium of his The Tip of the Goldberg columns. 
He resides in Cherry Hill, NJ with his wife Ruby, and son, Baby Bena beautiful boy who always makes the author smile and laugh with his sheer joy, kindness and playfulness.
