  <title>Being Berlusconi - Michael Day</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;People from all walks of life are appalled and fascinated in equal measure by the stratospheric political career of the tycoon and three-time Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Day provides an in depth look at the life and crimes of the shameless media mogul until his nine lives ran out and he faced definitive conviction which signaled his irreversible decline. He tells the story of a bright and ambitious man from a lower-middle class family who shook off his humble origins and rose to become rich and powerful beyond most people&#39;s dreams--a multi-billionaire whose Mediaset company remains one of Europe&#39;s largest television and cinema conglomerates. Along the way, amid the election victories, business triumphs, and womanizing, he became bogged down by his hubris, egotism, sexual obsessions, as well as his flagrant disregard for the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet how and why did Italy and Italians put up with him for so long?&lt;br&gt;With the 78-year-old&#39;s legal woes ongoing, including further trials for bribery, after a recent nine-month community service stint, &lt;i&gt;Being Berlusconi: The Rise and Fall from Cosa Nostra to Bunga Bunga &lt;/i&gt;is well-timed to mark the final chapters of a notorious--and astonishing--life and career.&lt;/p&gt;" />
