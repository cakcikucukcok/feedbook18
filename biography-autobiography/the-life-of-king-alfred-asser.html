  <title>The Life of King Alfred - Asser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One of the most important sources of information on Alfred the Great (King of Wessex from 871 to 899) is Asser&#39;s &quot;The Life of King Alfred&quot;. Asser was a Welsh monk who accepted a position in the court of King Alfred around 886. His work is both a translation of part of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (for the years 851-887), as well as eyewitness accounts and opinions of Alfred&#39;s kingship. Although the only copy of the manuscript was destroyed by fire in 1731, transcriptions and material from other writers ensured that the work was not lost forever. As a result, we have a revealing account of battles with Viking invaders, medieval English culture, consolidation of the seven kingdoms, and Alfred&#39;s efforts to revive religion and learning. Compared to the romantic and idealized royalty of Arthurian Legend, The Life of King Alfred gives a true, detailed portrayal of the actual kings of the Middle Ages." />

Who was Asser? Asser was a Welshman from St David’s, who later became Bishop of Sherborne.<br /><b><i>Asser's Life of King Alfred - The British Library</i></b> | The Life of King Alfred. In 893, Asser wrote a biography of Alfred entitled The Life of King Alfred; in the original Latin, the title is Vita Ælfredi regis Angul Saxonum. The date is known from Asser's mention of the king's age in the text.<br /><b><i>Asser - Wikipedia</i></b> | The subtitle “Asser’s Life of King Alfred and other contemporary sources” is a great description of this book. Along with Asser’s biography of King Alfred (and an incredibly extensive amount of footnotes) there are also translations of religious and philosophical books.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Life of King Alfred - Asser</a> </h3></p><hr/>
