  <title>Don&#39;t Let The Lipstick Fool You - Lisa Leslie, Larry Burnett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt; Foreword by Earvin &quot;Magic&quot; Johnson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Absolutely one of the best players ever to play the game.&quot;  --Bill Walton  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    A three-time Olympic gold medalist, three-time MVP of the WNBA, and the first woman ever to dunk in a professional basketball game, Lisa Leslie is considered one of the greatest players in the history of women&#39;s basketball.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    But before the superstar was the child growing up too fast in South Central Los Angeles. Over six feet tall in the sixth grade, with a father Lisa never knew, and a sister she couldn&#39;t trust, her life seemed destined to go nowhere fast--another failed statistic in the American dream.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Today, Lisa is a poised, beautiful, assertive, six-foot-five-inch basketball powerhouse. Her elegance and charm have made her a favorite with fans, the fashion world, and even Hollywood. With hard-won candor and confidence, Lisa Leslie shares in her own words her empowering story about finding grace under pressure, and exceeding expectations--including your own--by playing like a girl.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;     &quot;There are a lot of young girls out there who look up to Lisa Leslie. I think it&#39;s great that they can look at Lisa and say we don&#39;t have to make sacrifices.&quot;  --Sheryl Swoopes, Houston Comets and U.S. Olympic Team  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &quot;Lisa is doing for women what Michael Jordan has done for young men.&quot;  --Michael Cooper, Lakers great and L.A. Sparks head coach  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &quot;She has it all: beauty, brains, and athleticism. She brings class, fashion, and she&#39;s sassy in her own way. She has all that and the championship rings to back it up.&quot;  --Nancy Lieberman, ESPN analyst and Hall of Famer  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &quot;Lisa Leslie is absolutely one of the best players ever to play the game. She is a leader who works hard, plays hard, and carries herself with incredible poise, grace and dignity. She is an icon and a perfect role model.&quot;  --Bill Walton, ESPN commentator and NBA Hall of Famer    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &lt;b&gt;Larry Burnett &lt;/b&gt;is an Emmy award-winning journalist and sports broadcaster. He has known Lisa for fifteen years and has been the radio and television play-by-play announcer for her L.A. Sparks&#39; games for the past nine seasons. Burnett has anchored &lt;i&gt;Sports Center &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The NBA Today Show &lt;/i&gt;for ESPN, and he has hosted the Lakers&#39; radio broadcasts and &lt;i&gt;The Phil Jackson Show.&lt;/i&gt;" />
