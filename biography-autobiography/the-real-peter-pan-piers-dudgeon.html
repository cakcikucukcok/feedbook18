  <title>The Real Peter Pan - Piers Dudgeon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The world has long been captivated by the story of Peter Pan and the countless movies, plays, musicals, and books that retell the story of Peter, Wendy, and the Lost Boys. Now, in this revealing behind-the-scenes book, author Piers Dudgeon examines the fascinating and complex relationships among Peter Pan&#39;s creator, J.M. Barrie, and the family of boys who inspired his work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After meeting the Llewelyn Davies family in London&#39;s Kensington Garden, Barrie struck up an intense friendship with the children and their parents. The innocence of Michael, the fourth of five brothers, went on to influence the creation of Barrie&#39;s most  famous character, Peter Pan. Barrie was so close to the  Llewelyn Davies family that he became trustee and guardian to the boys  following the deaths of their parents. Although the relationship between the boys and Barrie (and particularly between Barrie and Michael) was enduring, it was punctuated by the fiercest of tragedies.   Throughout the heart-rending saga of Barrie&#39;s involvement with the  Llewelyn Davies brothers, it is the figure of Michael, the most original  and inspirational of their number, and yet also the one whose fate is  most pitiable, that stands out.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Real Peter Pan&lt;/i&gt; is a captivating  true story of childhood, friendship, war, love, and regret.&lt;/p&gt;" />
