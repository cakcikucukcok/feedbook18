  <title>A Perfect Captain - J C Noble</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Apart from the horrific events which occurred at St Pierre, Martinique in 1902, no one appears to have been greatly interested in the life of the man who was once described as &#39;a perfect captain&#39;.  Known mainly for being the captain of the Roddam, the only ship to have escaped from St Pierre, little else has been written about him until now. Born in 1864 he was apprenticed to the sea aged 15 and for the next twenty-five years sailed the world&#39;s seas, the first ten of which were on sailing ships. Along the way he met many fine clipper ship captains and seamen who generously shared their knowledge of the sea with him.  The eruption on Martinque was not his only adventure for he helped save lives on several occasions. Here is a man you would want beside you in times of danger. What made him the man he became? Decide for yourself because - this is his life." />
