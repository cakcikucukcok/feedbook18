  <title>Sanders Family: a Thousand-Year History - Carole Sanders, Peggy Sanders Van der Heide, Ralph Sanders, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book chronicles thirty generations and a thousand years of Sanders (and Saunders) family evolution beginning before Englands earliest days and ending across the Atlantic in colonial Virginia and later Kentucky. Family figures are described in their own distinctive historical contexts, and an extensive genealogy focused on Old World lineage is appended. Nearly a thousand chapter notes on sources and commentaries are furnished to assist readers interested in discovering their own ancestry. 
This new book revises and expands our earlier edition by extending family history another five generations and two hundred years into the deep past, correcting earlier literature on this subject. For the first time, the family coat of arms is decoded to learn its message. The portrayal of family activity and circumstances before and during the American colonial period are improved, and an appendix of previously unpublished Sanders vital records for the seventeenth century is included." />
