  <title>Uncle Martin&#39;s Family - Joyce Konzem Pertl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Uncle Martin was a man with a vivid memory and the God given gift of storytelling and rhyme. He spent the first 40 years of his life with his parents caring for them while they were earth bound. During those years he absorbed facts about his ancestors and enjoyed passing those stories on when opportunity arose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His stories are gathered together in this manuscript for his posterity and others to enjoy. The time spans four generations and from the Civil War to World War II. There are stories about scoundrels and about heroes. A greater portion covers the years of the Great Depression in the state of Kansas when he was growing up with his brothers and sisters. Many of the included stories are about everyday living at a time when everyone was struggling to make it to the next day. He testifies there were no crops, no jobs, and no money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what generation you are a part of you are sure to enjoy a true testimony of that time period as well as his personal view of family members and their antics. As with all families there were some he liked and approved of and others he viewed with skepticism and a little distaste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncle Martin passed away at the age of 89 before his stories could be published but he looked forward to that accomplishment. His family is very grateful to him for his effort as he was our last link to past family history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
