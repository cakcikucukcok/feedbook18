  <title>Bob &amp; Earl - David Lawrence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a friendship spanning 60 years, Earl Smith and Bob DiMatteo reminisce about their lives, their families and their country.  Longtime residents of Palmyra, a small town in Central Pennsylvania, they were born when the movies were silent and people were just becoming acquainted with the model T. They raised their children in a time and place where doors were unlocked and neighbors were family. They lived to understand Ipads and Avatar.
Earl and Bob share stories of their family, work, and play.  They had heroes like Babe Ruth, Dwight Eisenhower, Amos and Andy, Lowell Thomas, Dick Tracy, Tom Mix  and Milton Hershey. What Gone with the Wind was to Atlanta, Bob and Earl is to Palmyra.  It is a time that will never be again.
This book is a dramatic reminder of just why the millions of Bobs and Earls along with their wives Lennie and Cas were proud unsung members of the Greatest Generation, the generation that made America strong.  With steely focus, Bob and Earl, and their peers across the United States, built a better nation, one community at a time" />
