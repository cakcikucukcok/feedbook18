  <title>Beyond Providence - Rose Daniels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Migrating to Australia seemed a great idea to change her life and see another part of the world. And so, Barbara Walters, young, single and vivacious embarked on a journey into the unknown. 
She arrives in Melbourne on a wet, wintry day. Not the sunny and warm Australia she had expected to find.
Even more disappointing are the first weeks in her new job and strange surroundings. But then her present situation changes; she meets sleek Bernhard Gahlen, who initiates her into the laid-back way of Australian life. He even proposes marriage.
They spend their Christmas vacation together, exploring the outback. However, when they return from their trip, the relationship becomes less intense. Eventually Barbara faces heartbreak and dire consequences.
Devastated and alone, Barbara makes an ill-conceived decision, but it does not solve her problem. At some stage, Richard Ashton crosses her path. Though simple minded with odd habits, she cautiously accepts his friendship. But when he offers to marry her, she declines his kind gesture. Then, grim circumstances eventually force her to change her mind  She marries Richard for all the wrong reasons. He has secrets of his own. The marriage is doomed to fail.
A chance meeting brings Bruce Evans into Barbaras life. He convinces her that his love and support could provide a better life for her. It takes a long time for Barbara to commit herself to another relationship and when she does, she realises that nothing lasts forever. 
She had left Germany in search of love and a deeper meaning of life, but only found disappointment and more loneliness. Would she ever find love and a sense of belonging?
Adrian Jones finally makes her dreams come true. Their love for each other is rare and intense. At last, life seems worthwhile and plans for their future are made. Though going by past experiences, she wonders if she can hold on to her only ever true love.
