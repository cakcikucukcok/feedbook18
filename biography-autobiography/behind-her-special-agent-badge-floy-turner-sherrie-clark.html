  <title>Behind Her Special Agent Badge - Floy Turner, Sherrie Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Floy Turner is back, but this time she&amp;rsquo;s knee-deep in murder, kidnappings, and burglaries. Leaving behind her Florida Highway Patrol Trooper hat and Miami&amp;rsquo;s highways and byways, she dives into the world of high-level criminal investigations. Not only does she love it, but she finds she has a real knack for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this sequel to the best-seller BEHIND HER MIAMI BADGE, Turner takes on the role of special agent in the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Florida&amp;rsquo;s premier law enforcement agency. With an innate passion for justice, she and her teams don&amp;rsquo;t stop as they hunt down those perpetrators who threaten the public she swore to protect. As a result, serial murderers, robbers, and burglars, as well as dangerous fugitives, drug dealers, and human traffickers discover that they can run, but they can&amp;rsquo;t hide with Turner hot on their trails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strap yourself in and get ready to embark on a roller-coaster ride as BEHIND HER SPECIAL AGENT BADGE drops you behind the crime-scene tape before racing you through loops of page-turning action with peaks of humor sprinkled in along the way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
