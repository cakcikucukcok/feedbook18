  <title>Scientific Pilgrimage - Adébáyò Adésóyè</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Late Emeritus Professor V.A Oyenugas short biography is contained in about twelve international biographic documents. He is listed with Einstein as one of the Top 500 SCIENTIST OF THE 20TH CENTURY. He authored about 210 articles in several local and international scientific journals, most of them reporting the results of his original research in Africa, Europe and the United States of America. 
He was from Yoruba-land, Southwest Nigeria, from where countless numbers of slaves were shipped to Haiti, the Caribbean and the Americas between the 17th and 19th centuries. Despite his cerebral sagacity, he was a spiritual enigma, thickly woven into a fascinating puzzle! His biography is a scintillating cornucopia of some local and international events before and during the 20th century. It is also very informative about Nigerias past, present and unpredictable immediate future. The disparate north and south of this vast entity were Jack-knifed into a mere geographical adjective called Nigeria in January 1914, by a very restless and resourceful sadist; the British mercenary who was Nigerias first Governor- General in the early decades of the 20th Century: Baron Frederick Dealtry Lugard. 
If the world wants to know why post-colonial Nigeria has been adrift since the 1960s, and the factors and principal actors behind her present location up a very murky economic, social and political creek in the early decades of the 21st century; this book provides some interesting clues to the riddle of the odd dilemma facing the most populous black nation on earth Poor people, very rich government, stupendously wealthy rulers, in a limitlessly endowed nation where tragedy and comedy are Siamese twins!" />
