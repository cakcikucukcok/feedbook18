  <title>First - Lester Nuby Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Author &lt;b&gt;Lester Nuby Jr.&lt;/b&gt; began life in a dilapidated house in Bell Springs Mountain, Alabama, but now he is a successful businessman who doesnt have to worry about money. It wasnt easy for Nuby to scrounge his way out of poverty, a task made more difficult by the fact that his father was murdered just five months before he was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuby understood early on the difference between the haves and the have nots. He made it his mission to break free of the bondage of poverty. By the age of seven, he had already started taking notes that would become the ingredients for a personalized formula for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By following this formula, Nuby went from being a low-level employee at a company with hundreds of workers to its front office in eight years. When he became president, CEO, and chairman of the board, the company had annual sales of $70 million; he was just thirty-four years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join Nuby as he recalls how he broke the chains of poverty to lead companies throughout the world, and take a new view of economic disparity and how to seek justice in &lt;i&gt;First: Breaking Generational Poverty&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
