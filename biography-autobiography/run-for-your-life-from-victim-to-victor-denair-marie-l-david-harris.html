  <title>Run for Your Life: From Victim to Victor - Denair Marie, L. David Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll believe in miracles after reading this&amp;nbsp;one!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With his bare hands and a soul-numbing smirk, he violently twisted Denair&amp;rsquo;s neck and slowly began choking her to death! Her mind raced, &amp;ldquo;What does he mean it&amp;rsquo;s my fault? I have to die tonight?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Run for Your Life: From Victim to Victor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is an intriguing cat and mouse tale of how Denair Marie, an aspiring attorney, fled her dream job and her amazing new home. She ran for her life after her ex-boyfriend, who was charged with attempting to murder her, jumped bond and led federal Marshals on a harrowing chase. This monster was bent on silencing the only witness standing between him and a 10-year prison sentence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Her perpetrator didn&amp;rsquo;t know that Denair had an uncanny ability to run and survive. He didn&amp;rsquo;t have a clue she overcame living in subfreezing temperatures for months at a time as a nine year old. He had no idea she&amp;rsquo;d endured growing up in the worst housing project in New York City, or that her mom miraculously survived a brutal attack where she was stabbed more than 60 times.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This riveting memoir offers living, breathing proof that anyone can break free of violent, destructive bonds, in their race from&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Victim to Victor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
