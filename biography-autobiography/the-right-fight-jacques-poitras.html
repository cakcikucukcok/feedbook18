  <title>The Right Fight - Jacques Poitras</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In &lt;i&gt;The Right Fight: Bernard Lord and the Conservative Dilemma&lt;/i&gt;, CBC reporter Jacques Poitras provides a journalist&#39;s account of how Bernard Lord rose to the top in provincial politics and why his path could lead to Ottawa.  The clean sweep of Frank McKenna&#39;s Liberals in 1987 shook the foundations of the New Brunswick Progressive Conservative Party, but election night 1991 utterly shattered the Tory dream. As expected, the Liberals won a second majority, but the fervently anti-bilingualism Confederation of Regions (COR) Party formed the official Opposition. For the first time in a hundred years, the Conservatives were out in the cold, victims of vote-splitting on the right. In The Right Fight, Jacques Poitras reveals that, although drug and other scandals plagued Richard Hatfield&#39;s final years as premier, equally fatal was Hatfield&#39;s insistence on English-French equality within his party. It ruptured the already uneasy coalition he&#39;d built and sent old-style Tories flocking into COR&#39;s arms. It took the unexpected arrival of Bernard Lord, young and untried, to lead a dramatic reversal in the party&#39;s fortunes. Luring COR members back into the Conservative fold while maintaining the Red Tory base so carefully cultivated by Hatfield, Lord reunited the party and won back-to-back majority governments. Because of his success, Bernard Lord was vigorously and publicly courted as a potential leader of the new federal Conservative Party by backroom movers and shakers. In this revealing look at the 25-year struggle over language in New Brunswick, Jacques Poitras shows where Bernard Lord comes from and what challenges remain before him." />
