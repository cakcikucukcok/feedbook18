  <title>Crossbearer - Joe Eszterhas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Joe Eszterhas grew up in refugee camps and then in America&#39;s back alleys.  He worked as a police reporter, racing the cops to robberies and shootings. He interviewed and wrote about mass murders and serial killers. He wrote dark, sexually graphic, and violent films like &lt;i&gt;Basic Instinct&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Jagged Edge&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Jade&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Eszterhas knew a lot about darkness.  Then, on a hellishly hot day in 2001, desperately battling to survive throat cancer and his addictions to alcohol and cigarettes, Joe Eszterhas found God. Or God found him.&lt;br&gt;And he came from darkness into light.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Crossbearer&lt;/i&gt; is the powerful, poignant, and sometimes wryly humorous account of a streetwise and cynical man&#39;s newfound faith, and of how he discovers God in the most intimate and routine moments of life: a family game of baseball, a child&#39;s photograph of a cloud, a dying mother&#39;s dying roses.&lt;br&gt;It is also the inspiring story of a man who must overcome his addictions to stay alive--and can&#39;t by himself.  He realizes that he needs the love of his wife, his children, and especially his new friend, God, to do it.&lt;br&gt;Eszterhas is a master memoirist--his &lt;i&gt;Hollywood Animal &lt;/i&gt;was called &quot;powerful and affecting&quot; (&lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;), &quot;absolutely first-rate&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Times Book&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Review&lt;/i&gt;) and &quot;heartbreaking, funny and outrageous&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Houston Chronicle&lt;/i&gt;)--and with &lt;i&gt;Crossbearer&lt;/i&gt; he reveals a fresh and completely unexpected new chapter of his life. &lt;br&gt;With surprising tenderness and a willingness to bare even weaknesses and mistakes, Joe Eszterhas has written a startling personal story about faith, values, family and love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
