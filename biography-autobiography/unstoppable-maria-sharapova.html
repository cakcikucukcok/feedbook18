  <title>Unstoppable - Maria Sharapova</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Maria Sharapova, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;one of our fiercest female athletes, the captivating--&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;and candid--story of her rise from nowhere to tennis &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;stardom, and the unending fight to stay on top.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2004, in a stunning upset against the two-time defending champion Serena Williams, seventeen-year-old Maria Sharapova won Wimbledon, becoming an overnight sensation. Out of virtual anonymity, she launched herself onto the international stage. &quot;Maria Mania&quot; was born. Sharapova became a name and face recognizable worldwide. Her success would last: she went on to hold the number-one WTA ranking multiple times, to win four more Grand Slam tournaments, and to become one of the highest-grossing female athletes in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then--at perhaps the peak of her career--Sharapova came up against the toughest challenge yet: during the 2016 Australian Open, she was charged by the ITF with taking the banned substance meldonium, only recently added to the ITF&#39;s list. The resulting suspension would keep her off the professional courts for fifteen months--a frighteningly long time for any athlete. The media suggested it might be fateful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Sharapova&#39;s career has always been driven by her determination and by her dedication to hard work. Her story doesn&#39;t begin with the 2004 Wimbledon championship, but years before, in a small Russian town, where as a five-year-old she played on drab neighborhood courts with precocious concentration. It begins when her father, convinced his daughter could be a star, risked everything to get them to Florida, that sacred land of tennis academies. It begins when the two arrived with only seven hundred dollars and knowing only a few words of English. From that, Sharapova scraped together one of the most influential sports careers in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, for the first time, is the whole story, and in her own words. Sharapova&#39;s is an unforgettable saga of dedication and fortune. She brings us inside her pivotal matches and illuminates the relationships that have shaped her--with coaches, best friends, boyfriends, and Yuri, her coach, manager, father, and most dedicated fan, describing with honesty and affection their oft-scrutinized relationship. She writes frankly about the suspension. As Sharapova returns to the professional circuit, one thing is clear: the ambition to win that drove her from the public courts of Russia to the manicured lawns of Wimbledon has not diminished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharapova&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Unstoppable&lt;/i&gt; is a powerful memoir, resonant in its depiction of the will to win--whatever the odds.&lt;/p&gt;" />
