  <title>My Three Lost Girls - Su Anne Sherry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Growing up an orphan, author Su Anne Sherry often found herself adrift in lifebelonging to no one. As Sherry struggled to navigate the sometimes perilous waters of her life without parental guidance, she just wanted to know what it felt like to be loved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her poignant memoir, Sherry, called Sophie in her childhood, chronicles a lost and lonely little orphans hunger for affection and her struggle to understand her world as she battled instinctively to hold onto her true selfand her sense of humorin the face of institutional indifference, bureaucratic foibles, and human cruelty. Orphaned three months after she was born due to her mothers untimely death and her fathers chronic illness, little Sophie began her journey through foster care and subsequently life in an orphanage, where she learned to embrace random acts of kindness, develop her personality, and overcome daily challenges. As she slowly unveils memories from her coming-of-age journey, she illustrates the power of the human spirit to overcome even the greatest of challenges in order to realize true happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Three Lost Girls shares a heartrending, often humorous account of one womans pilgrimage from an unpredictable beginning in an orphanage to adolescent independence, where she finally discovers what it is like to be loved.&lt;/p&gt;" />
