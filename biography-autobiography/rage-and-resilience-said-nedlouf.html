  <title>Rage and Resilience - Said Nedlouf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 2007 my wife passed from breast cancer .. ever since I made it a point to dedicate a major part of my life to serve her memory in what can help others... loss back then, I spoke about my experience to few church based grief groups but mostly to close friends and loved ones... it was greatly received and brought tears to many; I knew then that I have a powerful and meaningful story to tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My beloved MK always encouraged me to write, but I always rejected or resisted the urge, despite knowing that I have always had a knack for it. I can express my feelings and thoughts with ease and with a certain degree of depth and poetic quality. I love to write, but have been too lazy to dedicate time to it, not to mention that I cannot make a living from it which is probably one of the reasons that I did not take the activity seriously... little did she know that my writing would be about her after she has passed away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that in a sort of cosmic, spiritual and supernatural way, the words would reach her and she can tap on my ideas, inner thoughts and feelings, as she is central to them all. I am also hopeful and confident that writing about her, and us, will cure my aching heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked away from this, and if you take nothing from my book please take this knowledge that I wish someone had given me in the beginning, the conviction that we as humans are one. We share that common seed from the one and only creator that we may refer to in different words and with different dogmas. Coexistence between all these faiths should be natural and ought not to even be a discussion, for we are all the same and coexisting in essence with each other!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end it all works out if we keep holding on to what is center and focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amen.&lt;/p&gt;" />
