&lt;p&gt;In this Memoir, Terzians aspirations to attend college meet parents refusal, flaring her yearnings even more. Consequently she quits her home in Cairo to work with the United Nations (UN) World Health Organization in Alexandria.Five years later she accepts a UN assignment in Congo, where civil war is rampant. She endures the rigors of expatriation, meanwhile saving funds for her college tuition. She also travels to eighteen countries across three continents for vacation and to visit her scattered family: cousin in Holland, brother in Armenia, and new relatives there, descendants of survivors from the Armenian genocide during World War I. While she is still in Yerevan, Comrade Khrushchev is overthrown. She manages to slip out of the Soviet Union safely and visit several countries in Africa on her way back to Congo.
