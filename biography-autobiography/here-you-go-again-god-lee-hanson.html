  <title>Here You Go Again, God! - Lee Hanson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Think Mission Impossible with miracles around every turn, and youll have, Here You Go Again, God!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Events that happen to each of us happen to the Hansonsunexpected, complicated life challenges and heartbreaking, seemingly hopeless medical diagnoses. The Hansons also seem to attract adventures that keep the Lord busy, protecting and saving them from sure death! In all of this and then some, the Lord has been with Lee and her family, answering prayers and working almost unbelievable miracles!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Excerpts from various chapters in HERE YOU GO AGAIIN, GOD!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Hanson, the medicine did not dissolve the clot in your husbands brain. I have to do surgery immediately! We may lose him, or he may be severely impaired, even with surgery, but we have to try, or hell be in a vegetative state the rest of his life!&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;******************************************************** &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So touched was Daves dad by the upturned, attentive faces before him, he almost didnt notice someone who came in late and stood alone in the back. A moment later, though, he realized the man who had just entered was the witch doctor! Dad took a deep breath and prayed for strength, as he wondered if there were men outside, ready to attack!&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;******************************************************** &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first we were speechless! Then I cried, Mom, why didnt you ever tell us about this before? Its amazing! A miracle that the Lord let you see! You saw Jesus come to carry Dad to Heaven? Why didnt you tell us?&lt;/p&gt;" />
