      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The story of O&amp;rsquo; Mista&amp;rsquo; Whadda&amp;rsquo; Wata&amp;rsquo; Bug! is a fictional account of these two perky little bugs who had made their home inside of this most beautifully crafted, handmade rug.&lt;br /&gt; Life for them was pretty snug indeed! That is, until the rug where they stayed was shipped off to a place called Twitterville. There was absolutely no way they could have ever imagined (with the events that followed ) that in this small town of Twitterville, their little bug world would be turned literally, upside down!&lt;br /&gt; Their lifelong friendship is soon put to the test. One of the bugs has a very strange dream and wanted to pursue it. But when he told his little friend about it, the friend tries to persuade him otherwise.
