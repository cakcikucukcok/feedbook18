  <title>ANIMAL STORIES FROM THE INUIT or Animal Stories from Eskimo-Land - Dr. Daniel Neuman, Translated &amp; Published by Renee Riggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The 19 Eskimo, or Inuit, stories in this volume were collected by Dr Daniel Neuman in his travels across Alaska between 1910 and 1921, along with over 3,000 artefacts which now form the Neuman Collection in Juneau Alaska.&lt;br /&gt;
These stories were extracted from Dr Neuman&amp;rsquo;s collection, translated and published by Mrs Renee Riggs, wife of then Governor of Alaska Thomas Riggs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
More recently governments in Canada and Greenland have ceased using the term &amp;quot;Eskimo&amp;quot; in official documents. Instead, Canada has officially replaced the term &amp;quot;Eskimo&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;Inuit.&amp;quot; In recognition of this change, the title of this book has been altered from &amp;ldquo;Animal Stories from Eskimo-Land&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Animal Stories from the Land of the Inuit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These children&amp;rsquo;s stories are not like your typical Western fairy tale, with a princess in distress being rescued by a Knight in shining armour. Like most Native American children&amp;rsquo;s tales, these impart a lesson, or a wisdom, to teach Inuit children important life lessons while also being extremely entertaining. These 19 children&amp;rsquo;s stories are enhanced by 15 colourful headpieces and 7 full page colour plates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The stories in this volume are:&lt;br /&gt;
The Journey to Eskimo Land&lt;br /&gt;
Ivango or the Lost Sister&lt;br /&gt;
The Robin, the Crow and the Fox&lt;br /&gt;
The Proud Mouse&lt;br /&gt;
The Crow and the Daylight&lt;br /&gt;
The Orphan Boy&lt;br /&gt;
A Race Between a Reindeer and a Tom-Cod&lt;br /&gt;
Why They Have Summer on St. Lawrence Island&lt;br /&gt;
The Lost Son&lt;br /&gt;
The Crow and the Owl&lt;br /&gt;
The Running Stick&lt;br /&gt;
The Treacherous Crow and His Cousin, the Mink&lt;br /&gt;
Good and Bad Weather&lt;br /&gt;
How the White Whales Happened&lt;br /&gt;
A Giant and His Drum&lt;br /&gt;
Lovek and Seranak&lt;br /&gt;
The Caribou&lt;br /&gt;
A Fox Story&lt;br /&gt;
Mi-e-rak-puk&lt;br /&gt;
===================&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;DANIEL NEUMAN&lt;/b&gt; was born in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1869. His grandfather, a physician, had first gone to Russia with Napoleon&amp;#39;s army in 1812 but was wounded in battle. He recovered and remained in Russia to work for the Imperial Government Service.&lt;br /&gt;
