  <title>Grandpa&#39;s Stories - Ronald (Ronn) L. Shank</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A number of years ago now as one of my grandsons first birthday approached I thought about what to give a one year old. There are a million things that will be played with for a short while then either broken or ignored. I wanted to give something special, something lasting, something that even when older he might still enjoy. Then it struck me, since he likes the silly little stories I tell him upon his request, that maybe I could write some cute little short stories, with a moral as well, just for him (and any of my other grandchildren as well when shared). Thats all it took to get me started. Since then each year I write a little story that somehow relates to something in his life. When another grandchild came along he also was added to the list of recipients of original stories. When I got to thinking about it I decided there may be other grandparents that would like to spend time with their grandchild reading a little story. Now a few years down the pike and I have enough for a book. And so herein I offer my readers a chance to share the joy of time spent reading to a child. That is why my stories were written in the first place.
Children go through phases as with my grandchildren there were the dinosaurs, whales, (especially the blue whale), hedge hogs, puppies and gold fish. Im sure you get my drift. All of these fed my imagination and help to produce stories that have a connection and personal touch for both the child and me.
These stories are not written for children to read, but rather for a loving adult to sit down with child on their lap or side by side on a shared sofa and be read to. I recommend using funny voices and lots of emphasis and maybe a tickle or two at just the right moment to add flavor and a garnish to each story. The giggles, like sparklers on the 4th of July, will shower joy in all directions and warm the heart of the one reading the story and those close by.  
Do not be concerned about the content all the stories contained in this book are rated PG - (to be read by Parent or Grandparent). I hope you will enjoy these short stories even more that I did writing them." />
