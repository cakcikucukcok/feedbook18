  <title>Splintered (Splintered Series #1) - A. G. Howard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;This stunning debut captures the grotesque madness of a mystical under-land, as well as a girl&amp;rsquo;s pangs of first love and independence. Alyssa Gardner hears the whispers of bugs and flowers&amp;mdash;precisely the affliction that landed her mother in a mental hospital years before. This family curse stretches back to her ancestor Alice Liddell, the real-life inspiration for Lewis Carroll&amp;rsquo;s &lt;I&gt;Alice&amp;rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland&lt;/I&gt;. Alyssa might be crazy, but she manages to keep it together. For now.&lt;BR /&gt; When her mother&amp;rsquo;s mental health takes a turn for the worse, Alyssa learns that what she thought was fiction is based in terrifying reality. The real Wonderland is a place far darker and more twisted than Lewis Carroll ever let on. There, Alyssa must pass a series of tests, including draining an ocean of Alice&amp;rsquo;s tears, waking the slumbering tea party, and subduing a vicious bandersnatch, to fix Alice&amp;rsquo;s mistakes and save her family. She must also decide whom to trust: Jeb, her gorgeous best friend and secret crush, or the sexy but suspicious Morpheus, her guide through Wonderland, who may have dark motives of his own.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; Read all the books in the&lt;I&gt; New York Times &lt;/I&gt;bestselling Splintered series: &lt;I&gt;Splintered (&lt;/I&gt;Book 1&lt;I&gt;), Unhinged &lt;/I&gt;(Book 2&lt;I&gt;), Ensnared (&lt;/I&gt;Book 3&lt;I&gt;), &lt;/I&gt;and&lt;I&gt; Untamed (&lt;/I&gt;The Companion Novel&lt;I&gt;).&lt;/I&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt; Get books 1 through 3 in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abramsbooks.com/product/splintered-box-set_9781419728211/&quot;&gt;Splintered boxed set&lt;/a&gt;, available now!&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;Praise for &lt;I&gt;Splintered:&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;B&gt;STARRED REVIEW&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;quot;Fans of dark fantasy, as well as of Carroll&amp;rsquo;s Alice in all her revisionings (especially Tim Burton&amp;rsquo;s), will find a lot to love in this compelling and imaginative novel.&amp;quot;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;mdash;&lt;I&gt;Bulletin of the Center for Children&amp;#39;s Books&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/I&gt;Alyssa is one of the most unique protagonists I&amp;#39;ve come across in a while.
