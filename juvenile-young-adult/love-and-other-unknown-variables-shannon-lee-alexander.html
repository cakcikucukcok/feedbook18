  <title>Love and Other Unknown Variables - Shannon Lee Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Charlie Hanson has a clear vision of his future. A senior at Brighton School of Mathematics and Science, he knows he&#39;ll graduate, go to MIT, and inevitably discover solutions to the universe&#39;s greatest unanswered questions. He&#39;s that smart. But Charlie&#39;s future blurs the moment he reaches out to touch the tattoo on a beautiful girl&#39;s neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The future has never seemed very kind to Charlotte Finch, so she&#39;s counting on the present. She&#39;s not impressed by the strange boy at the donut shop--until she learns he&#39;s a student at Brighton where her sister has just taken a job as the English teacher. With her encouragement, Charlie orchestrates the most effective prank campaign in Brighton history. But, in doing so, he puts his own future in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time he learns she&#39;s ill--and that the pranks were a way to distract Ms. Finch from Charlotte&#39;s illness--Charlotte&#39;s gravitational pull is too great to overcome. Soon he must choose between the familiar formulas he&#39;s always relied on or the girl he&#39;s falling for (at far more than 32 feet per second squared).&lt;/p&gt;" />
