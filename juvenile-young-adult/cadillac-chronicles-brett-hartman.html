  <title>Cadillac Chronicles - Brett Hartman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;P&gt;Sixteen year-old Alex Riley&amp;#8217;s top priorities in life are to find his long-absent father and a girl with a decent set of breasts. But his mother has a knack for sabotaging his plans. To advance her political career, she takes in an elderly black man named Lester Bray. Lester arrives with a vintage Cadillac and an old man&#39;s personality. It takes only a week for Alex&#39;s mother to ask Lester to leave. That makes Alex angry. On the morning of his eviction, Lester and Alex set out on a road trip ostensibly to find the boy&#39;s father in Ft. Lauderdale. But the two don&#39;t just head south. They also cross through un-navigated political, racial, and personal territory. A wild ride, &lt;I&gt;Cadillac Chronicles&lt;/I&gt; explores what it means to&amp;#151;finally&amp;#151;find a real friend.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brett Hartman&lt;/B&gt; lived an unremarkable life in Fort Lauderdale until May 18, 1983, when he was arrested for aggravated battery. While away at Auburn University, he suffered a psychotic breakdown and months of intensive treatment. Though he made a full recovery, the events of that period never left him. He continued his education at Indiana State, where he received a doctorate in clinical psychology; he has worked as a psychologist ever since. His memoir &lt;I&gt;Hammerhead 84&lt;/I&gt; covers his journey through the mental health industry. &lt;I&gt;Cadillac Chronicles&lt;/I&gt; is his debut novel. He lives in Albany, New York, with his wife and their two sons.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
