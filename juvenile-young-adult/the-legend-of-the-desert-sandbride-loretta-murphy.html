  <title>The Legend of the Desert Sandbride - Loretta Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Legend of the Desert Sandbride presents a tale centering on a young woman
who is doomed by a witch to roam the Sahara Desert as a result of her decision to
flee from an arranged marriage.
Pained at the thought of spending her life with Odoma, the tribes strongest and
most fierce warrior, Tula runs away from her village on the day of her wedding.
In despair, the bride encounters an old woman who leaves her with a hopeless
future. The witch bears a grudge against Tulas father, compelling her to transform
the girl into a sand being whose job is to provide water to those in need until true
love rescues her. Meanwhile the king of the Noo Noos tribe decides to send his
son Malik out to seek the Tree of Plenty to save his people from a great famine.
Along the way, Malik encounters the spirit of the desert. His journey through the
hot desert requires him to overcome challenging obstacles. He meets the Sandbride.
His initial reaction to her appearance causes her to run away. Two mystical
creatures are summoned to travel with Malik. Although Maliks travel seems dim,
he eventually secures Tulas release, and she returns to her original state after the
witchs evil deeds result in her demise.
In the conclusion of The Legend of the Desert Sandbride, the couple is greeted
by sounds of celebration as Maliks journey seems to bring about revitalization of
his people as well as of Tulas." />
