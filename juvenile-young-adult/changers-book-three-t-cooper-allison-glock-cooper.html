  <title>Changers Book Three - T Cooper, Allison Glock-Cooper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&quot;This series takes the ultimate teen experience&amp;#151;not feeling comfortable in one&amp;#8217;s own skin&amp;#151;and folds it into a fantastical premise: with each year of high school, a young Changer wakes up as an entirely different person . . . While living with new identities might encourage empathy for other people, the more immediate concern for many Changers is how to survive a year of high school. Readers will connect with Kim as she tentatively makes new friends; watches Audrey, the girl she still cares about, from afar; and struggles with who she is and who she wants to be, while finding comfort in the theater crowd. This strong entry in the series is a good choice for readers looking for books about friendship, identity, and LGBTQ issues.&amp;#8221;&lt;BR&gt;--&lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;School Library Journal&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Kim&#39;s voice and the banter between characters are funny, and they feel real. The identity and marginalization issues loom large, but instead of being shoehorned into side characters, they&#39;re scooped up and taken into a deeper, entertaining, fantastic narrative.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;--&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;Kirkus Review&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Praise for the Changers series:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;&lt;I&gt;Changers&lt;/I&gt; should appeal to a broad demographic.

In &lt;I&gt;Book Three&lt;/I&gt; of the groundbreaking Changers series, Oryon awakens as Kim Cruz, an Asian American girl whose body looks nothing like she expected or desired.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Where &lt;I&gt;Changers Book One: Drew&lt;/I&gt; dealt primarily with issues of gender and bias, and &lt;I&gt;Changers Book Two: Oryon&lt;/I&gt; explored issues concerning race and bigotry, &lt;I&gt;Changers Book Three: Kim&lt;/I&gt; tackles the thorny, less straightforward subjects of body shaming, self-esteem, grief, mental illness, and how the expectations of the outside world can&#39;t help but color the way we see ourselves.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Kim--smart, funny, and finally fed up with the cards she&#39;s been dealt--is finding out that friends change, love doesn&#39;t always mean forever, and growing up means living your truth, even if it isn&#39;t pretty.&lt;/div&gt;" />
