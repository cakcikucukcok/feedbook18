With determination and a little deception, Jenny figures out how to observe ballet class without actually participating, and she practices in the safety of her home. Then Jenny meets her polar opposite: Ara Reyes, a bold, spontaneous, and accident-prone girl who longs for the spotlight but is overlooked in favor of the schools star performer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The girls friendship blossoms as they help each other find their real talents. Aras dancing takes a leap forward, and Jenny discovers she has a hidden gift for choreography. With the support of the schools newest teacher, Jennys original ballet might just make it on stage  but will she?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charming and inspiring, &lt;em&gt;Dancing on the Inside&lt;/em&gt; shows how pursuing our passions can often lead to wonderful and unexpected results.&lt;/p&gt;
