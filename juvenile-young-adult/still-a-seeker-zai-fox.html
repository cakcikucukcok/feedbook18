      <meta name="description" content="Veenad&#39;s seeking has helped motivate the Boda community to start a warrior/healer school. The influx of students brings on its own complications. There are groups that try to assassinate anyone who starts demonstrating warrior/healer abilities. There are also other groups that try to hold these students down to protect their positions.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But just as the warrior/healer school starts to gain momentum a war reaches the region&#39;s southern border. The developing warrior/healers become crucial to protecting the region. In addition, there are all kinds of complexities since the characters of their allies are often greatly flawed.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;So while the warrior/healers and their allies are outnumbered, their emphases on developing abilities to fight and to heal are able to impact the outcome of the conflicts. But their impact is never as much as they would like.&lt;/P&gt;" />
