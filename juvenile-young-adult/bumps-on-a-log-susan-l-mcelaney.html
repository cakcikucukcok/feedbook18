  <title>Bumps on a Log - Susan L. McElaney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Grammie comes to babysit on a beautiful spring day, shes in for a big disappointment. No matter what she does to entice Karis Brynn and Grady Wayne to play with her, her two grandchildren refuse to participate! They wont even change out of their pajamas. They just want to sit around like two bumps on a log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They refuse to get dressed. They refuse to silly dance. They refuse to sing. They even refuse to go outside with Grammie to enjoy the beautiful, glorious, gorgeous spring day. She has never seen her two darling grandchildren behave like this before, and shes not going to stand for itnot for another minute! Luckily, grandmothers are very resourceful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youll be surprised to find out what happens when Grammie tells her darling grandchildren that they are nothing but bumps on a log. Youll be even more amazed to see what Karis Brynn and Grady Wayne do when Grammie turns the tables and becomes the biggest bump on a log of all. Will she shake them out of their blues, or will the beautiful day be ruined?&lt;/p&gt;" />
