  <title>The Fair Folk of Doon Hill - Janette Bond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Deep in the heart of the Trossachs countryside, in Scotland, lies the village of Aberfoyle. To the south east of the village is a hill called Doon Hill. Legend has it that this is the home of the Sidhe (pronounced shee), or Faery Folk. It is said that in 1692, the minister of the parish, Reverend Robert Kirk, was spirited away by the Faery Folk as a punishment for revealing their secrets. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Meet Hamish, his granny and other characters inside this book. They are gnomes, guardians of the oak trees. Their homeland; the woody knoll called Doon Hill. Their duty; to take care of sick animals and to protect the oak woodlands. Their biggest enemy; owls! Their greatest delight; to sing and dance celebrating the forest gods. Their biggest hate; humans who call them faeries, blame them for troubles and show them no respect. &lt;/P&gt;" />
