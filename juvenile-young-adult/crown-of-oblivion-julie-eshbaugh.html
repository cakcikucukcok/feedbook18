  <title>Crown of Oblivion - Julie Eshbaugh</title>

That&amp;#8217;s just a fact for Astrid, an Outsider who is indentured to pay off her family&amp;#8217;s debts. She serves as the surrogate for the princess&amp;#8212;if Renya steps out of line, Astrid is the one who bears the punishment for it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is a way out: the life-or-death Race of Oblivion. First, racers are dosed with the drug Oblivion, which wipes their memories. Then, when they awake in the middle of nowhere, only cryptic clues&amp;#8212;and a sheer will to live&amp;#8212;will lead them through treacherous terrain full of opponents who wouldn&amp;#8217;t think twice about killing each other to get ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what throws Astrid the most is what she never expected to encounter in this race. A familiar face she can&amp;#8217;t place. Secret powers she shouldn&amp;#8217;t have. And a confusing memory of the past that, if real, could mean the undoing of the entire social structure that has kept her a slave her entire life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competing could mean death&amp;#8230;but it could also mean freedom.&lt;/p&gt;" />
