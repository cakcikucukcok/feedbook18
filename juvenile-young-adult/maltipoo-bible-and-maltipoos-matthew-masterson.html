&lt;b&gt;-What Makes Maltipoos So Great?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;They will get along with just about anyone, whether an adult, child or another animal. They are playful. This dog is not the kind to lazily hang around the house when there is playtime to be had!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-Because Maltipoos are eager to please, this also makes them very easy to train&lt;/b&gt;. Maltipoos are smarter than they look.

&lt;br /&gt;
