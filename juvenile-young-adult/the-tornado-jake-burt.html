  <title>The Tornado - Jake Burt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;One of the best stories about bullying for middle grades. Highly recommended.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;School Library Journal, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;starred review&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bell Kirby is an expert at systems, whether he&#39;s designing the world&#39;s most elaborate habitat for his pet chinchilla, re-creating Leonardo da Vinci&#39;s greatest inventions in his garage, or avoiding Parker Hellickson, the most diabolical bully Village Green Elementary has ever seen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since third grade, Parker has tormented Bell, who&#39;s spent two long years devising a finely tuned system that keeps him out of Parker&#39;s way. Sure, it means that Bell can&#39;t get a drink when he wants to, can&#39;t play with his best friend on the playground, and can&#39;t tell his parents about his day, but at least he&#39;s safe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until Daelynn Gower touches down in his classroom like a tornado.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bell&#39;s not sure why the new girl, with her rainbow hair, wild clothes, and strange habits, is drawn to him, but he knows one thing--she means trouble. It&#39;s bad enough that she disrupts Bell&#39;s secret system, but when Daelynn becomes the bully&#39;s new target, Bell is forced to make an impossible decision: Finally stand up to Parker. . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or join him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
