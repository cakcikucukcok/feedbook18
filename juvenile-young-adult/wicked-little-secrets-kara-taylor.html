Although things have settled (somewhat) since her roommate Isabella&#39;s death, Anne&#39;s still kind of obsessed with the death of Wheatley student Matthew Weaver thirty years ago, since she found a picture of him and his crewmates with the words &quot;they killed him&quot; scrawled on the back among Isabella&#39;s things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Anne learns that her boyfriend Brent&#39;s dad is one of the now-powerful Wheatley alumni who rowed crew with Matthew, and that the crew team continues to induct new members with a creepy-sounding ritual called &quot;The Drop,&quot; she knows further investigation could put her relationship with Brent in danger.  Determined to discover the truth, she reaches out to Anthony, Isabella&#39;s townie brother, who helps her delve deeper into the secrets in Wheatley&#39;s past. Secrets someone would kill to keep hidden.  As the school&#39;s Spring Formal--and its notorious afterparty--approaches, Anne sees the perfect opportunity to do some off-campus digging into the lives of Wheatley&#39;s VIPs in this thrilling, unputdownable read--but if she&#39;s not careful, she&#39;ll be the next student who never comes back.&lt;/p&gt;" />
