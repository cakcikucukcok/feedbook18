  <title>Shakespeare&#39;s Secret - Elise Broach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt; Hero changed into a T-shirt, grabbed a book, and padded barefoot into her sister&#39;s room. The large windows overlooked the backyard. She could see the moonlight streaming over the trees and bushes, making long, crazy shadows across the grass. Was there a diamond hidden out there somewhere? She looked at Beatrice, already settled under the covers. She wanted to tell her about the Murphys, but at the same time, she didn&#39;t. She wanted to keep the secret. To have something that belonged only to her.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A missing diamond, a mysterious neighbor, a link to Shakespeare-can Hero uncover the connections?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Hero starts sixth grade at a new school, she&#39;s less concerned about the literary origins of her Shakespearean name than about the teasing she&#39;s sure to suffer because of it. So she has the same name as a girl in a book by a dusty old author. Hero is simply not interested in the connections. But that&#39;s just the thing; suddenly connections are cropping up all over, and odd characters and uncertain pasts are exactly what do fascinate Hero. There&#39;s a mysterious diamond hidden in her new house, a curious woman next door who seems to know an awful lot about it, and then, well, then there&#39;s Shakespeare. Not to mention Danny Cordova, only the most popular boy in school. Is it all in keeping with her namesake&#39;s origin-just much ado about nothing? Hero, being Hero, is determined to figure it out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this fast-paced novel, Elise Broach weaves an intriguing literary mystery full of historical insights and discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JUNIOR LIBRARY GUILD SELECTION&lt;/p&gt;" />
