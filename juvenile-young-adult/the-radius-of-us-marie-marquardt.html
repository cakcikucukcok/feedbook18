  <title>The Radius of Us - Marie Marquardt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What happens when you fall in love with someone everyone seems determined to fear?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Ninety  seconds can change a life -- not just daily routine, but who you are as a  person. Gretchen Asher knows this, because that&#39;s how long a stranger  held her body to the ground. When a car sped toward them and Gretchen&#39;s  attacker told her to run, she recognized a surprising terror in his  eyes. And now she doesn&#39;t even recognize herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ninety  seconds can change a life -- not just the place you live, but the person  others think you are. Phoenix Flores Flores knows this, because months  after setting off toward the U.S. / Mexico border in search of safety  for his brother, he finally walked out of detention. But Phoenix didn&#39;t  just trade a perilous &lt;i&gt;barrio&lt;/i&gt; in El Salvador for a leafy suburb in Atlanta.  He became &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; person -- the one his new neighbors crossed the street to avoid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ninety seconds can change a life -- so how will the ninety seconds of Gretchen and Phoenix&#39;s first encounter change theirs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Told in alternating first person points of view, &lt;i&gt;The Radius of Us&lt;/i&gt;  is a story of love, sacrifice, and the journey from victim to survivor.  It offers an intimate glimpse into the causes and devastating impact of  Latino gang violence, both in the U.S. and in Central America, and  explores the risks that victims take when they try to start over. Most  importantly, Marie Marquardt&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Radius of Us&lt;/i&gt; shows how people struggling to overcome trauma can find healing in love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
