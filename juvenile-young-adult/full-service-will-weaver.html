  <title>Full Service - Will Weaver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The times they are a-changin&#39; . . .&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The summer that Paul turns sixteen his mother pushes him to take a job in town instead of just working on the family farm. &quot;You need to meet the public,&quot; she says, which is saying a lot for a woman deeply committed to the tightly knit religious community to which they belong. And meet the public Paul does: He meets Kirk, the angry gas station manager; Harry, a reclusive and kindly gangster; and a family of hippies passing in a yellow peace van to San Francisco. He also meets beautiful Peggy, a high school sensation, and dark-haired Dale, her onthe-side boyfriend who is headed to Vietnam. All of them come to the station - as well as girls on summer vacation, tanned and smelling of coconut oil, and ministers from Paul&#39;s fundamentalist church, who are worried about his soul. As the summer progresses, Paul learns the secrets of his small Minnesota town and discovers that he&#39;s ready to have a few secrets of his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With richly developed characters and a flair for arresting imagery, Will Weaver tells the story of the end of one boy&#39;s innocence, unfolding at a time when the country as a whole is undergoing a difficult, deeply disturbing coming-of-age.&lt;/p&gt;" />
