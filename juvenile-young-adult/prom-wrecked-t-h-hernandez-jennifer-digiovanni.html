  <title>Prom-Wrecked - T.H. Hernandez, Jennifer DiGiovanni</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Their prom night ended in a jail cell with forty of their closest friends. But that&#39;s hardly the worst thing that happened to them...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the principal announces prom is canceled this year, senior Riley Hart is determined to save it. Armed with little more than her own enthusiasm, she ends up working closely with Owen Locklear, who is more than completely off-limits. Because he&#39;s the boyfriend of her ex-BFF, Catherine Reed. Still, Owen knows Riley better than almost anyone, and his charming ideas for turning the prom upside-down and backward win Riley over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catherine is willing to join Owen and Riley on the prom committee, but only because her legacy as prom queen is at stake. She&#39;s already suffocating under the weight of her parents&#39; expectations for after senior year, and compared to that, ensuring prom happens should be easy. At least until everything starts to go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First they lose their deposit. Then they book a band full of octogenarians. And lose their venue... Twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riley will have an unforgettable teenage experience, damn it, if it&#39;s the last thing she does...&lt;/p&gt;" />
