  <title>The Mudhog That Stole Groundhog Day - Jane Kopper Hilleary</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It had been an especially cold and hard winter for human and animals alike. It was the coldest, snowiest winter on record. A crowd was now anxiously gathered at the burrow hole of Uncle Root, the groundhog who each year foretold the fate of spring. If he saw his shadow, it meant six more weeks of winter. If he didnt, the celebrations could begin. This year, Uncle Root just couldnt bear to announce there would be six more weeks of winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next door, Mudhog Morris watches the commotion, seething with anger. He is jealous of Uncle Root and the attention he gets this time of year. What does he know? Mudhog Morris decides to do something about it. But his actions have dire consequences for the entire community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A picture book for children, The Mudhog that Stole Groundhog Day shares a tale about what happens when someone tells a lie.&lt;/p&gt;" />
