  <title>Freddy the Firefly Shines His Light - Leslie Tierney, Justin Canha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;About The Book&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freddy the Firefly lives in a comfortable, old tree house with his mom, dad, and his baby sister, Gloria Glowworm. Freddys best friend, Frankie, swoops by every night and invites Freddy to play by the lake. One night, Freddy decides to ignore his moms flash dance, which signals him its time to fly home. The next day, Freddy must deal with a series of unfortunate incidents at school and at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freddys teacher, Mrs. Flutterby, has a sparkly personality with a special glow. She not only teaches her fireflies about science, but imparts valuable character lessons as well. Mrs. Flutterby encourages her fireflies to share their positive traitstheir glowwith everyone they meet. Freddy finally takes this lesson to heart. The power of a simple, kind gesture to his friend, Fiona, creates a chain reaction that causes a magical glow in the classroom. Until one day, Mrs. Flutterby isnt her usual sparkly self. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Freddy the Firefly Shines His Light, by author Leslie Tierney and illustrator Justin Canha, children learn that, just like Freddy, they have a positive glow to share with the world and make it a better place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A whimsical story that teaches children about consequences, outcomes and the joy of helping one another. This book is destined to become a favorite; children will revisit Freddy over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freddy The Firefly Shines His Light is the delightful tale of how Freddy learns the gift of encouraging others. The story is beautifully written...the descriptive words and phrases make this story come to life. While the main point of the story is the lesson Freddy learns about kindness, the author also weaves in some interesting facts about fireflies. The character of Freddy is one with whom children will connect. The illustrations are bright and cheerful. Reading this story gave me a special glow! I look forward to reading this to my students and my seven year old son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freddy The Firefly Shines His Light is perfect for a school author visit or as part of a character education program. Young children ages four through nine will be captivated by Freddy the Firefly and learn valuable lessons as well.&lt;/p&gt;
