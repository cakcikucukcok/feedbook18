  <title>Quarry Grove - Clive Tandy, J. McLean</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Quarry Grove&lt;/b&gt; is a small community sat just on the edge of the Known Universe, where Hicky the Caterpillar has applied to the B.A.U.C. (Butterflies Association of Unwinged Caterpillars) for his permanent Wings many, many times. Although he has successfully obtained his training Wings on a couple of occasions, so far Hicky has been lucky if he has managed to keep his learner wings for more than a day. The reason for Hicky&#39;s constant failure to achieve his full Wings is his terrible safety record - he tends to spend more time landing on his neighbours than he does in the clouds. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With the Butterfly Association meeting at Log Hall already arranged, Hicky is feeling confident that he will get his full Wings. This time, he has enlisted the help of Snirell Snail, (who is convinced his granddad is a wizard) plus with the aid of an invention by Percy Verence, (the only scientist worm in the Grove). With the support of his friends, Hicky is feeling a little more optimistic that his meeting with the B.A.U.C will finally achieve his dream of becoming a butterfly!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However there is a sinister plot taking shape! Crooked cockroach Eddy Kray and his confused sidekick Boris the Spider have other plans for Hicky the Caterpillar and Percy&#39;s fabled new flying invention. 
Will the Temporary Winged Party go ahead at the Slug and Sucker? 
Will Snirell Snail and Berty Beetle be able to hide their fear of the dark when the lights go out at Log Hall?
Will PC Bluebottle be able to stop Eddy Kray and Boris the Spider in time for his Fly-kovsky recital night?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Read the story and find out the answers to all these questions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Hicky Gets His Wings&lt;/i&gt; is the first tale in the fully illustrated &lt;b&gt;Quarry Grove&lt;/b&gt; series
