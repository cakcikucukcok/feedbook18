  <title>A Frog Called Pepper - H. G. Thompson, Frances Espa単ol</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Pepper is a big, beautiful frog that lives on a pond. He has shiny green skin and big black eyes. Despite his magnificent looks, though, Pepper is terrified of many thingsincluding other frogs on the pond. His only friend is Happy, who is happy all the time. Pepper wishes he could be more like his friend, but hes just too afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hes afraid the wind might blow him away. Hes afraid the sun might not come up in the morning. Hes afraid of making new friends because he thinks other frogs might judge him. Hes so busy being afraid that he forgets to live. Happy does his best to talk Pepper out of his fears, but Pepper is more concerned with what might happen than what is actually happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will Pepper be able to escape this horrible cycle of fright? He doesnt want to be scared and alone forever, but its going to take a lot of bravery on his part to change the way he thinks. With Happys help, Pepper must find solutions to his fears. He must become a friendly frog, no longer worrying about what might be but accepting what is with joy, courage, and love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
