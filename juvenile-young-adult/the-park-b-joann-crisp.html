  <title>The Park - B. Joann Crisp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mars only wanted to get away from his past and where he ended up was no accident. The Park boasts of its amazing ability to give its visitors the one thing they want most: a second chance to see their dearly departed in Heaven, Shangri-La, Valhalla, or simply, the realm of the dead. For Mars, the Park failed to give him the answers he so desperately wanted and he&#39;s lived as a vagrant in the small border-town that plays host to The Park for the last five years. Mars makes a living selling counterfeit tickets to tourists, but he and the rest of the world are beginning to notice that those who purchase counterfeit tickets end up paying a much higher price. When ghosts from his past start popping up in town, Mars is forced into action, risking everything he knows to save the souls he&#39;s sacrificed to The Park." />
