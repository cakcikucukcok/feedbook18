  <title>The Astonishing Maybe - Shaunta Grimes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Friendship, heartbreak, and defining what family means are rarely as sensitively, beautifully portrayed in middle-grade fiction. Shaunta Grimes is an extraordinary new talent.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gideon hates the idea of moving to Nevada from the East Coast. It&#39;s so empty and hot in his new neighborhood. Only one person his age lives nearby: the girl next door, Roona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gid notices right away that Roona is . . . different. She wears roller skates and a blanket as a cape when she needs to feel strong. What he doesn&#39;t bargain for, however, is how far outside his comfort zone Roona will take him as she enlists his help in finding her long-gone father. For a kid who&#39;s not allowed to ride his bike more than a few blocks from home, this will be an adventure of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;" />
