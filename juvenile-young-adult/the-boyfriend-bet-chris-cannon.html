So naturally, she kisses him. Out of spite. Not only is Grant her brother&#39;s number-one nemesis, but he has zero interest in being tied down to one girl. She&#39;s shocked--and secretly thrilled--when they start spending more time together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zoe&#39;s brother claims Grant is trying to make her his &quot;Ringer,&quot; an oh-so-charming tradition where a popular guy dates a non-popular girl until he hooks up with her, then dumps her. Zoe threatens to neuter Grant with hedge clippers if he&#39;s lying but Grant swears he isn&#39;t trying to trick her. Still, that doesn&#39;t mean Grant is the commitment type--even if winning a bet &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; on the line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer: This Entangled Teen Crush book contains multiple PDAs, after-school detentions, and gambling on the side.
