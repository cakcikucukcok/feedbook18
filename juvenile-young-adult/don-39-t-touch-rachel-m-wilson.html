  <title>Don&#39;t Touch - Rachel M. Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Step on a crack, break your mother&amp;#39;s back,&lt;br /&gt;Touch another person&amp;#39;s skin, and Dad&amp;#39;s gone for good . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caddie has a history of magical thinking&amp;#8212;of playing games in her head to cope with her surroundings&amp;#8212;but it&amp;#39;s never been this bad before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When her parents split up, &lt;em&gt;Don&amp;#39;t touch&lt;/em&gt; becomes Caddie&amp;#39;s mantra. Maybe if she keeps from touching another person&amp;#39;s skin, Dad will come home. She knows it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense, but her games have never been logical. Soon, despite Alabama&amp;#39;s humidity, she&amp;#39;s covering every inch of her skin and wearing evening gloves to school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s where things get tricky. Even though Caddie&amp;#39;s the new girl, it&amp;#39;s hard to pass off her compulsions as artistic quirks. Friends notice things. Her drama class is all about interacting with her scene partners, especially Peter, who&amp;#39;s auditioning for the role of Hamlet. Caddie desperately wants to play Ophelia, but if she does, she&amp;#39;ll have to touch Peter . . . and kiss him. Part of Caddie would love nothing more than to kiss Peter&amp;#8212;but the other part isn&amp;#39;t sure she&amp;#39;s brave enough to let herself fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From rising star Rachel M. Wilson comes a powerful, moving debut novel of the friendship and love that are there for us, if only we&amp;#39;ll let them in.&lt;/p&gt;" />
