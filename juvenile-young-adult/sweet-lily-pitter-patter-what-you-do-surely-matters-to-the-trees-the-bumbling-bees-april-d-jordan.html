  <title>Sweet Lily Pitter Patter, What You Do Surely Matters: (To the Trees &amp; the Bumbling Bees) - April D. Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As Sweet Lily Pitter-Patter stares out the window at the rain falling from the sky, she tries to make sense of all that matters. A few minutes later, while perched on her mother&#39;s lap, Lily closes her eyes and drifts into a dream world where she is about to discover all the ways she can honor the earth. With her mother&#39;s voice to guide her on her sleepy journey around the world, Lily traverses magnificent mountains, caves, deserts, and streams while learning to think with her mind and lead with her heart. As she realizes how her everyday choices impact the environment around her, Lily learns the important lesson that preserving the earth starts with her. In this delightful children&#39;s picture book that integrates playful language with a focus on global awareness, a little girl explores nature and all its beautiful creatures and becomes empowered to help take care of her world." />
