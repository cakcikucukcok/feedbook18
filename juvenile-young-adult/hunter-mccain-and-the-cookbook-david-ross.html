  <title>Hunter Mccain and the Cookbook - David Ross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Remember middle school? Being afraid to wear the wrong clothes, scared of saying something stupid in class or awkward attempts at that first kiss? How about parents who don&#39;t understand? Or, teachers who put you to sleep in 0.2 seconds? Hunter McCain is living through all this and much more as an eighth grader at Franklin Middle School.  Add in a cookbook filled with recipes far more interesting then lasagna or a casserole. Love potions, strength formulas, and invisibility are just some of the entrees offered up in the archaic treasure. But these recipes may not be the tastiest; brownies sprinkled with toe nails, fudge using arm pit hair, or gum made from spider webs could just ruin an appetite.  Come on the zaniest adventure of a life time as Hunter and his friends use the cook book to encounter bullies, pretty girls, school projects, a dodge ball tournament, parents and even bank robbers." />
