      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An early chapter book from Newbery Medal winner Betsy Byars&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Boo brings home a dinosaur that only she can see, her brother Sammy, doesn&#39;t want to encourage her antics. Boo and her dinosaur are inseparable until Boo says good-bye to the dino quite suddenly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Sammy sees how sad his sister is, he understands Boo&#39;s need for her dinosaur more than he wants to admit. So much so that he almost believes it . . . almost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Betsy Byars has written many chapter books, including &lt;i&gt;Little Horse&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Little Horse on His Own&lt;/i&gt;. Her language, perfectly tailored to beginning readers, combines with Erik Brooks&#39;s charming illustrations to make a delightful book for children who are just starting to read. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Boo&#39;s Dinosaur&lt;/i&gt; is a 2007 Bank Street - Best Children&#39;s Book of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
