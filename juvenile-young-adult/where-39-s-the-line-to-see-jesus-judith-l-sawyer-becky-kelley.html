  <title>Where&#39;s the Line to See Jesus? - Judith L. Sawyer, Becky Kelley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is written with love based on a true story.  Becky Kelley took her nephew to see Santa and he asked, &quot;Where&#39;s the line to see Jesus?&quot; &lt;br&gt;It is our hope that this book brings a great message into your hearts and homes about the true meaning of Christmas.  May you all be blessed by the innocence of children and enjoy the view of the world through their eyes.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Judith L. Sawyer is a Catholic, born and raised, and has a psychology degree specializing in Marriage and Family.  Her inspiration comes first from her cousin Adolf Alexander Noser, S.V.D. who was an Arch Bishop in Papua New Guinea who lived his whole life serving God, wrote a few books himself and when she was 7 he blessed her.  Currently he is going through the beatification stage of being canonized a saint.  His book &lt;i&gt;Living with God in My Heart&lt;/i&gt; will soon be republished. &lt;br&gt;Judith&#39;s inspiration also comes from her children.  She is a mother of three and was searching for a book to teach them how to pray and who God was.  Not being able to find one resulted in the writing of her first book &lt;i&gt;This Is How I Pray&lt;/i&gt;.   &lt;br&gt;She writes, &quot;My children are significant to me because when I was 27 I had a brain tumor with a rare disease and was told it was improbable that I would ever have children.  So for them I am grateful to God.  I believe that God uses everyone for His purpose and I wanted to share that with children when they are young so they understand the gravity of their lives from a higher perspective.  I love God for my life and am ever so grateful to be able to share my experiences to help in my own little way to make the world a better place for our children.&quot; &lt;p&gt;Becky Kelley was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri. She first sang on stage at the ripe age of 2 and never looked back. Singing and dancing her way through high school, she ended up going to college in Nashville, Tennessee at David Lipscomb University. It was there, she started to get a taste of the Nashville music scene, singing and performing with some of Nashville&#39;s best. &lt;br&gt;After college, Becky decided to go back home, get married, and settle into a family life. Apparently life had other things in store, as she eventually found herself being pulled back into music, recording in the studio and welcoming an exciting new chapter into her life all while embracing her current life at home. While life has gotten busier, it has also become richer. Becky loves using her gifts both in the professional world and also singing her baby girl to sleep at night, praying God is leading her every step of the way." />
