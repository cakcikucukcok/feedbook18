  <title>Hollywood Days with Hayes - Hayes Grier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Twelve days and twelve nights in Hollywood with Hayes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hayes Grier has just landed his first big Hollywood role, the lead in a big budget blockbuster film. There he meets Violet Reeves, an aspiring writer, who has also been given her first big break. If she aces her new job as Hayes&#39;s assistant on the film, which means making sure he is on time, knows his lines, and doesn&#39;t get himself killed, the director will read Violet&#39;s own screenplay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only problem? Violet has a huge crush on Hayes. She has to keep her emotions in check, impress Hayes, and add some heart to her script. But what about Violet&#39;s heart? Does Hayes feel the same way about Violet as she does about him?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media superstar Hayes Grier sets this story, based on the hit story on Episode (the world&#39;s largest interactive storytelling app), during the hot days and long nights of a Hollywood shoot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to this novel, fans will get an exclusive, never-before-seen Q&amp;A with Hayes, A Perfect Day with Hayes, and some family photos!&lt;/p&gt;" />
