  <title>Tim Green&#39;s Baseball Collection - Tim Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author and former NFL defensive end Tim Green delivers baseball tales with sports action and emotional heart that will keep kids on the edge of their seats. This collection contains three bestselling novels in the series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pinch Hit&lt;/em&gt;: Trevor and Sam look alike. But their lives couldn&amp;#39;t be more different. Trevor is a movie star, living the Hollywood life in a huge mansion with his own limo, pool, and bowling alley. There&amp;#39;s nothing he doesn&amp;#39;t have except the one thing he wants most: to play baseball for real. Sam is a regular kid who seems to have what it takes to make it to baseball&amp;#39;s Major Leagues. He&amp;#39;s determined to get the scouts at the big USC tournament to recognize his talent. When Sam signs up at Casting Central to make some extra money, he and Trevor come together on a movie set and see the chance to trade places&amp;#8212;to pinch hit for each other and make everyone&amp;#39;s dreams come true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Force Out&lt;/em&gt;: Joey and Zach have always been best friends. They&amp;#39;re also two of the best baseball players in their league, and shoo-ins for the all-star team at the end of the season. Their dream is to play together on the Center State select team, and they will do anything to help each other get there. Then the boys learn there&amp;#39;s only one open spot on the select team. Suddenly Joey and Zach go from being best friends to biggest rivals, and Joey has to decide his next move. He can play the biggest game of his life, or he can use a secret they share to force Zach out. How far should Joey go to win?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Kid&lt;/em&gt;: Tommy&amp;#39;s the new kid in town&amp;#8212;who now goes by the name Brock&amp;#8212;and he&amp;#39;s having a hard time fitting in. Thanks to a prank gone wrong, he may be able to settle in on the baseball team. But can he prove himself before he becomes a new kid . . . again?&lt;/p&gt;" />
