O-Zone invites Nick to visit space station Elmira with him. There, the two learn that the peaceful planet of Caldaris is in trouble. A great beast who never sleeps is destroying the planets natural resources and threatening the existence of the Caldarian civilization. Desperate for help, the prince of Caldaris asks Nick and O-Zone to travel aboard a powerful spaceship to his planet to investigate the threat and hopefully save the planet and its people from extinction. After enlisting help from a young adventurer and her exotic horse, Nick and O-Zone bravely face the threat head-onall while dealing with spaceship malfunctions, dodging asteroids, and battling evil aliens.
In this exciting adventure, a young Protector and his robot friend embark on a dangerous journey through space to fight an intergalactic battle and stop a beast of unimaginable power before it destroys the universe and all its inhabitants forever." />
