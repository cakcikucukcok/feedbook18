  <title>Country Living - Donald Ball</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the fourth book in a five-book series. The first book introduces Ted and describes his sailboat-building experiences. After some trouble at home, he moves in with Grandpa and Grandma and goes to a one-room country school. 
In book two, Ted is helped by his new friend Woody to learn to play the guitar and sing. They play on street corners to make a little money, and it gives them long hours of practice. Teds dog, Spot, really helps their street act with his headstands and backflips. Grandpa teaches Ted to plow behind their mules, and the boy makes money plowing gardens for people in town.
Plowing and entertainment relieve the poverty at Grandpas house, and in the third book, Ted buys an icebox so that Grandma can make Jell-O. Later, he is able to buy a Model A roadster that comes with a trailer full of mowing equipment. Everything is going well until Ted gets a bad boil on his leg and needs help from his doctor friend. 
Book four tells about graduation from a country school and Teds first chance to get Delta Cemetery all dressed up for Memorial Day. The wheat harvest is important work for Ted that helps determine the finances for the year. He still has to work at fixing the house up with a water pump." />
