  <title>Frostfire - Amanda Hocking</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hidden deep in the heart of a snow-covered wilderness lies the secret kingdom of the Kanin--a magical realm as beautiful as it is treacherous...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Bryn Aven has never fit into Kanin society. Her blond hair and blue eyes set her apart as an outsider--a half-blood unable to hold a respectable rank. But she&#39;s determined to prove herself as a loyal protector of the kingdom she loves. Her dream is to become a member of the King&#39;s elite guard, and she&#39;s not going to let anything stand in her way...not even her growing feelings for her boss, Ridley Dresden. A relationship between them is strictly forbidden, but Bryn can&#39;t fight her attraction to him. And she&#39;s beginning to think he feels it too. Meanwhile, there&#39;s an attack on the kingdom--one that will test Bryn&#39;s strength like never before. Finally, she has the chance to confront Konstantin Black, the traitor who tried to kill her father years ago. It&#39;s up to Bryn to put a stop to him before he strikes again. But is she willing to risk everything to protect a kingdom that doesn&#39;t accept her for who she really is? And when her mission brings her closer to Ridley, will she be able to deny her heart?&lt;/p&gt;" />

Frostfire is the first entry in Hocking’s second series set in her troll-verse, a world exactly like our own but with the addition of human-resembling trolls who love nature, live in elaborate out of the way communities, and acquire wealth by placing some of their children in human families as changelings.<br /><b><i>Frostfire (Kanin Chronicles, #1) by Amanda Hocking</i></b> | AMANDA HOCKING is The New York Times bestselling author of the Trylle and Watersong series and a lifelong Minnesotan. She made headlines by selling more than a million copies of her books, primarily in eBook format.<br /><b><i>Frostfire (Kanin Chronicles Series #1) by Amanda Hocking ...</i></b> | I think Frostfire is even more spectacular. Amanda Hocking just keeps getting better and better!"--Watcha Reading"A must read… now I have to run out and buy the Trylle trilogy as well!"--Jump into Books"For those who love a great trilogy, there's a new one on the horizon…Frostfire is a great first installment of the Kanin Chronicles.
