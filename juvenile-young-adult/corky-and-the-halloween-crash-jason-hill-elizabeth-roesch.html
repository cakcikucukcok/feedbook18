  <title>Corky and the Halloween Crash - Jason Hill, Elizabeth Roesch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the moment he was born, everyone knew Corky was a very special little clown. His nose beamed beautifully, and his hair was the richest orange imaginable. Even Mrs. McConkie knew Corky was destined for greatness, and everyone in the funny little town of Funnyvale respected Mrs. McConkies opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that Corky is old enough for school, he and his two best friends, Jimmy and Biff, are getting ready for what promises to be a wonderful Halloween. Their trick-or-treating is going greatuntil the boys realize that someone has given them apples instead of candy! Showing off their skills, each of the boys uses his apple to complete a stunt. But when Corkys turn comes up, his apple crashes straight through the window of none other than Mrs. McConkie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Corky has made a serious mistake. What will he do? What would you do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
