  <title>The Mozart Season - Virginia Euwer Wolff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Remember, what&#39;s down inside you, all covered up--the things of your soul. The important, secret things . . . The story of you, all buried, let the music caress it out into the open.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Allegra was a little girl, she thought she would pick up her violin and it would sing for her--that the music was hidden inside her instrument.&lt;br&gt;     Now that Allegra is twelve, she believes the music is in her fingers, and the summer after seventh grade she has to teach them well. She&#39;s the youngest contestant in the Ernest Bloch Young Musicians&#39; Competition.&lt;br&gt;     She knows she will learn the notes to the concerto, but what she doesn&#39;t realize is she&#39;ll also learn how to close the gap between herself and Mozart to find the real music inside her heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Mozart Season&lt;/i&gt; includes an interview with author Virginia Euwer Wolff.&lt;/p&gt;" />
