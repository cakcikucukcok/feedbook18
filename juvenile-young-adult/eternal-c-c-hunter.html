  <title>Eternal - C. C. Hunter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Spectacular! I love Della&#39;s sarcastic and yet deeply sensitive perspective and can&#39;t wait to see how things unfold for her.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;Fresh Fiction&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Just when Della feels like she&#39;s starting to figure out her life, she finds herself &lt;/i&gt;reborn&lt;i&gt;...and her new existence comes with a whole different rulebook.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Della&#39;s secret powers always made her feel like an outsider in the human world. Now, just when she&#39;s starting to feel like she belongs--at Shadow Falls, a camp for teens with paranormal powers--her life is turned upside down all over again. Attacked by a deadly virus, she must make the difficult choice to be &lt;i&gt;reborn&lt;/i&gt;. It&#39;s her only chance at survival, but it comes with a price: It irreparably bonds her to Chase, a tall, dark and mesmerizing vampire who makes her laugh one minute and infuriates her the next.&lt;br&gt;Chase already knows too many of Della&#39;s secrets, and being eternally bonded to him is the last thing she wants. Even worse, she doesn&#39;t fully understand what their bond means. Is the attraction she&#39;s started feeling for Chase real--or does fate have something else in store? And what does that mean for Steve, the hot shapeshifter whose kisses make her weak in the knees? Now Della&#39;s battered heart is about to take another hit. While investigating her latest case, she discovers shocking evidence about her father&#39;s dark past, making her question everything she believes to be true...and her place in the world she loves.&lt;/p&gt;" />
