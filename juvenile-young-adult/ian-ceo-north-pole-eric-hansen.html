  <title>Ian, CEO, North Pole - Eric  Hansen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever wondered how Santa manages to get ready for Christmas Eve? Just who&#39;s in charge at the North Pole, anyway? Actually, it takes a business CEO - which stands for Chief Executive Officer - to make sure everything runs smoothly, and Santa could sure use one. Children will love the book &quot;Ian, CEO, North Pole.&quot; which blends modern day technology with Christmas spirit. Ian is a shy but bright and upcoming member of Santa&#39;s workshop. He loves a challenge, and Santa sees Ian as definite management potential, but first Ian has to prove himself. He has to undergo some heavy-duty training but soon finds a trusted ally and friend in Elise, and they make an outstanding team. See what happens one Christmas Eve when somewhere over Middle America heavy fogs rolls in, Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer starts sneezing and his bright nose flickers out, and Santa is in for the shock of his life. What can Ian and Elise do to put Santa back on track? This brilliantly written tale reminds us that Christmas is a state of mind and the true spirit of the holiday season is what brings us all together. And finally - Children can benefit from leadership skills at an early age. They can gain more self-esteem and interact more easily and effectively with peers. In this book they can follow Ian and Elise as they acquire their leadership skills." />
