  <title>Zack and Zara Chew at the Zoo with Mrs Anteater - Sarah Chaplin, Amanda O&#39;Donnell Shaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Twins Zack and Zara receive an annual pass to the zoo for their birthday and use it to visit Mrs. Anteater and her new baby. They eat a healthy picnic, including avocado, and watch the zookeeper feed Mrs. Anteater an avocado for a treat. Can you imagine Zack and Zaras excitement when they discover that they can talk to a zoo animal that eats the same food as them? Zack and Zara have fun learning from Mrs. Anteater about how she is different and why she eats avocados. Zack and Zara make the connection that they are animals too and learn the benefits of eating avocados and healthy fats for their bodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zack and Zara Chew at the Zoo is a great learning tool for children, with positive, healthy messages. It is important to teach children about nutrition while they are young so they can carry their healthy habits throughout their lifespan. Sarah did an excellent job explaining healthy fats and unhealthy fats in a way that children can understand, and she wrote the book in a playful, creative way. This book is a wonderful way to start having healthy discussions with your children or students. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
