His dad spends most of his time and money at the local pool hall; his brother flips through jobs like a thumb through a deck of cards; and his mom never stops cleaning the house, as though one day the rooms will be so spotless they&amp;#39;ll disappear into a sparkle, and she&amp;#39;ll be free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manny&amp;#39;s dad is always saying that people are like money--there are million- and thousand- and hundred-dollar people out there, and to him, Manny is just a penny.

He wants to find out what it means to be a &lt;em&gt;vato firme, &lt;/em&gt;a guy to respect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this beautifully written novel, Victor Martinez gives readers a vivid portrait of one Mexican-American boy&amp;#39;s life.
