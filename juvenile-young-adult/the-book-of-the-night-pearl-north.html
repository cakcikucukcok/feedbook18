  <title>The Book of the Night - Pearl North</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The thrilling, magical conclusion of the Libyrinth trilogy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world of the Libyrinth has experienced a series of wrenching changes. After the Libyrarians and their longtime foes the Singers discovered their common heritage, a young healer named Po found the Lion&#39;s Bloom, an ancient and enormously powerful artifact capable of rewriting reality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind the mysteries of their shrouded past has always been the legendary Book of the Night. Sought for generations, both feared and revered, it is the key to this world of wonders. When vain, grasping Queen Thela steals the Lion&#39;s Bloom and imperils the very reality of the world, only the Book can heal what she has rent asunder. An epic journey through strange lands, a perilous encounter in a clockwork city, and the revelation of the truth beyond reality will lead those who find the Book to a moment when their world will either be saved...or cease to exist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Told with the grace and skill that only Pearl North can bring to the tale, &lt;i&gt;The Book of the Night &lt;/i&gt;is a breathtaking adventure that will linger in the memory long after the final page is turned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
