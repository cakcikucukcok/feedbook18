  <title>Shakespeare | Cut - Bruce R. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In distracted times like the present, Shakespeare too has been driven to distraction. Shakespeare | Cut considers contemporary practices of cutting up Shakespeare in stage productions, videogames, book sculptures, and YouTube postings, but it also takes the long view of how Shakespeare&#39;s texts have been cut apart in creative ways beginning in Shakespeare&#39;s own time. The book&#39;s five chapters consider cuts, cutting, and cutwork from a variety of angles: (1) as
bodily experiences, (2) as essential parts of the process whereby Shakespeare and his contemporaries crafted scripts, (3) as units in perception, (4) as technologies situated at the interface between &#39;figure&#39; and &#39;life,&#39; and (5) as a fetish in western culture since 1900. Printed here for the first time are
examples of the cut-ups that William S. Burroughs and Brion Guysin carried out with Shakespeare texts in the 1950s. Bruce R. Smith&#39;s original analysis is accompanied by twenty-four illustrations, which suggest the multiple media in which cutwork with Shakespeare has been carried out." />
