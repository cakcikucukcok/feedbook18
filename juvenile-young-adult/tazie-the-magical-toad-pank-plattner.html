  <title>Tazie the Magical Toad - Pank Plattner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Oliver is tired of being told what to do all the time, which is why he says as he falls asleep, I wish I was a grown-up so I could do whatever I want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning his mom sends him to his room for misbehaving. There, he meets a magical toad named Tazie who had been listening to him the night before. The toad hands Oliver three golden coins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these coins represents a wish, Tazie explains. You have to throw one coin up into the air, make a wish, and catch it in your hand before it falls to the ground. If you can catch the coin, your wish will come true. Remember to use your wishes wisely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oliver wishes to be a train conductor and a firefightertwo types of grown-ups that he thinks must enjoy exciting lives. But he quickly discovers that the jobs arent as easy as they seem. He uses his last wish for a room filled with fun and goodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Oliver is left wanting only one thing: to return home. With no magical coins left, hell need to convince Tazie to grant him one last wish.&lt;/p&gt;" />
