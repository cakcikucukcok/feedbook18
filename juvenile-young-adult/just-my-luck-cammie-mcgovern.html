  <title>Just My Luck - Cammie McGovern</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critically acclaimed author Cammie McGovern&#39;s&amp;#160;powerful and heartwarming middle grade&amp;#160;novel will appeal to readers who loved R.

He hasn&#39;t found a new best friend. He&#39;s still not a great bike rider&amp;#8212;even though his brother George, who&#39;s autistic, can do tricks. And worst of all, he worries his dad&#39;s recent accident might be all his fault. Benny tries to take his mom&#39;s advice and focus on helping others, and to take things one step at a time. But when his dad ends up in the hospital again, Benny doesn&#39;t know how he and his family will overcome all the bad luck that life seems to have thrown their way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just My Luck&lt;/em&gt; is a deeply moving and rewarding novel about a down-on-his-luck boy whose caring heart ultimately helps him find the strength to cope with tragedy and realize how much he truly has to offer his friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;" />
