  <title>Charlie, the Crocodile who Couldn&#39;t Catch a Cold - Rosita Bird, Lynn Costelloe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A parent always worries that their child will catch cold in the winter weather if they don&amp;#39;t wrap up warm. The &lt;strong&gt;Animal Alphabet &lt;/strong&gt;series by Rosita Bird continues with the story of Charlie, the foolish Crocodile, who is so sure he can&amp;#39;t possibly catch a cold that he won&amp;#39;t wear his warm clothes. Lost in the snow, he is rescued by a volunteer from an animal shelter, who traces his mother and returns Charlie to his home. Charlie has indeed caught a cold, and learns to wrap up warm during cold weather in future!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Charlie&amp;#39;s mother is traced by means of Charlie&amp;#39;s microchip, so this gentle warning also introduces the concept of animal rescue centres and the important work they do helping and rehoming animals, inspired by the animal shelter where the author&amp;#39;s own beloved rescue dog was sourced.&lt;/p&gt;" />
