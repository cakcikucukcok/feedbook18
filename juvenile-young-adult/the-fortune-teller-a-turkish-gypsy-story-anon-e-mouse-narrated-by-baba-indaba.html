  <title>THE FORTUNE TELLER - A Turkish Gypsy Story - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 432&lt;br /&gt;
In this 430th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Turkish Fairy tale of &amp;ldquo;The Fortune Teller&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
A long, long time ago in Turkey there was once a widow who had three daughters. One spun cotton, the others sewed, and thus they earned their daily bread.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once these girls saw a gipsy passing along the street, and said to each other: &amp;quot;Let us have our fortunes told.&amp;quot; All agreeing, they called the old woman, who, having had her hand crossed with silver, said to the eldest of the sisters: &amp;quot;Thy kismet is at the bottom of a well.&amp;quot; To the middle sister she said: &amp;quot;Thy kismet is in the cemetery&amp;quot;; and to the youngest she said: &amp;quot;Thy kismet is in shame.&amp;quot; Having uttered these ominous words, the gipsy disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One day while the eldest girl was spinning, her thread broke, the spindle flew up ward, then fell and rolled over and over until it suddenly disappeared down the well. &amp;quot;Oh dear!&amp;quot; she exclaimed, &amp;quot;my spindle is in the well; help me to recover it.&amp;quot; Her sisters bound a rope round her body and let her down the well&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? Did the rope break and did she manage to be pulled out of the well, or did something else entirely happen? And what of their Kismet (karma, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; fate, destiny, fortune?) To find the answers to these questions, and any others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
