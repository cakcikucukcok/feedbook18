  <title>Struck - Jennifer Bosworth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mia Price is a lightning addict. She&#39;s survived countless strikes, but her craving to connect to the energy in storms endangers her life and the lives of those around her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles, where lightning rarely strikes, is one of the few places Mia feels safe from her addiction. But when an earthquake devastates the city, her haven is transformed into a minefield of chaos and danger. The beaches become massive tent cities. Downtown is a crumbling wasteland, where a traveling party moves to a different empty building each night, the revelers drawn to the destruction by a force they cannot deny. Two warring cults rise to power, and both see Mia as the key to their opposing doomsday prophecies. They believe she has a connection to the freak electrical storm that caused the quake, and to the far more devastating storm that is yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mia wants to trust the enigmatic and alluring Jeremy when he promises to protect her, but she fears he isn&#39;t who he claims to be. In the end, the passion and power that brought them together could be their downfall. When the final disaster strikes, Mia must risk unleashing the full horror of her strength to save the people she loves, or lose everything.&lt;/p&gt;" />
