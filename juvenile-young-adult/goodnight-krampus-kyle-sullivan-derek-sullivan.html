  <title>Goodnight Krampus - Kyle Sullivan, Derek Sullivan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Created by identical twin brothers (Kyle is the author and Derek is the illustrator), Goodnight Krampus is their first follow-up to their regionally successful debut, Monster ABC.&lt;li&gt; Goodnight Krampus is their adorable take on the Bavarian Christmas demon, Krampus, a character that has attained a level of serious cultural cache on the internet over the past few years, even getting his own major motion picture in 2015.&lt;li&gt; As Monster ABC taught us, monsters don&#39;t have to be scary—and Krampus is no exception. Re-imagined for young children as a gently mischievous youngster, little Krampus takes the form of an overexcited child on Christmas Eve who&#39;s too excited to sleep. Visually inspired by the classic Rankin/Bass stop-motion Christmas movies, this bedtime story is a whimsical ode to Christmas excitement. &lt;li&gt; Appeals to children and parents alike with a scenario that both sides can identify with: a tired parent’s frantic attempts to convince an overexcited youngster that sometimes going to bed is in the best interests of everyone.&lt;li&gt; Derek and Kyle decided to make Krampus the star of their first follow-up to Monster ABC, as he was the runaway favorite from Monster ABC that fans mentioned and discussed the most at author events.&lt;li&gt; Written in thoughtfully crafted verses with a playful lullaby cadence, Goodnight Krampus was carefully created to become a bedtime favorite no matter what time of year it is.&lt;li&gt; Due to the character’s popularity, there is a glut of Krampus books on the market, most of which have been hastily created to exploit a new cultural icon. Thanks to the beautiful illustrations, lovely verses, and cast of side characters, Goodnight Krampus is certain to become a beloved holiday classic. &lt;li&gt; The internet discovered Krampus a few years ago, and it hasn’t shut up about it since. In only a few short years, the Bavarian mythological creature (the yin to Santa’s yang) has skyrocketed from obscure to omnipresent. Krampus is having his cultural moment in America as a delightfully wicked counterbalance to Santa’s unyielding goodness. He is celebrated all over the country on Christmas sweaters, greeting cards, scares, and even in a 2015 feature film. &lt;li&gt; By the author and illustrator team who created Monster ABC, Get Dressed, Sasquatch!, Hush Now, Banshee! and Don&#39;t Eat Me, Chupacabra! (¡No Me Comas, Chupacabra!)&lt;li&gt; The second book in the Hazy Dell Press Monster Series, the other titles including Monster ABC (2018), Get Dressed, Sasquatch! (2018), Hush Now, Banshee! (2018) and Don&#39;t Eat Me, Chupacabra! (¡No Me Comas, Chupacabra!) (2018). &lt;li&gt; By the illustrator of Party Croc! (Albert Whitman, 2015)&lt;li&gt; Awards and accolades for Goodnight Krampus include: &lt;li&gt; Seattle Times ShopNW Holiday Gift Guide (2017)&lt;li&gt; 30 full-color illustrations&lt;li&gt; Much longer, more robust and detailed than most children’s board books&lt;li&gt; Hefty, durable weight &lt;/ul&gt;" />
