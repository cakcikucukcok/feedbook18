  <title>GYPSY FOLK TALES - BOOK TWO - 39 illustrated Gypsy tales - Anon E. Mouse, Retold by Francis Hindes Groome, Newly Illustrated by Maggie Gunzel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This second volume is a treasure chest of classic illustrated Gypsy Folklore stories and contains a further 39 Gypsy stories, tales and legends from Transylvania, Slovakia, Moravia, Bohemia, Poland, England, Wales and Scotland.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Herein you will find stories like &amp;ldquo;The Black Dog of the Wild Forest&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;The Three Dragons&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;The Brigands and the Miller&amp;#39;s Daughter&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Bobby Rag&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;De Little Fox&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;The Green Man of Noman&amp;#39;s Land&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;The Tinker and His Wife&amp;rdquo; plus many, many more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once again, the stories have been illustrated by Dutch artist Maggie Gunzel whose art has stayed true to the stories themselves.&lt;br /&gt;
Francis Hindes Groome collated and prepared this collection, making only few changes and remaining true to the original stories, so to let the written story enchant us as if it were being presented in the vernacular.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In his various other works, Groome raises the point that Europe possibly owes a great deal of its folklore heritage to Gypsies, who brought tales from East to West. If this is the case, then even the most rooted of Europeans must attribute a portion of their culture to the Gypsy lifestyle. Simply stated, these stories are their stories, but in an earlier form.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So take some time out and curl up with this book. Be swept back in time to another place, where the carefree lifestyle of the Gypsy rules and the burdens of today are forgotten - albeit temporarily.&lt;br /&gt;
In buying this book you will have donated towards the relief of the underprivileged people of Romania through the Relief Fund for Romania.&lt;br /&gt;
