  <title>Olivia and the Red Box from the Beach - Edwin C. Rivera</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Olivia and the Red Box from the Beach is about a young girl strolling down the beach of her little village and finding a beautiful red box floating in the water. She, being so excited in finding this red box, ran through the village yelling that she had found this box. The village people, upon seeing the red box that Olivia had found, desired to have the box and yelled to Olivia, Give me the box! Share whats inside the box with us! But Olivia was very adamant on not sharing whats inside the box till she first opens it to see whats inside. She showed it to her mom, and she was not able to open the box. Being frustrated and not being able to open the box, Mom suggested several people in the village that might be able to help her. All in all, she was not able to open the box until she finally met one person that did open it for her. To Olivias surprise, after opening the box, it was something she had never expected. It was empty! The moral of this story is love, and that is what Olivia is supposed to share with everyone else. Now Olivia was very happy to share this love with everyone in the village." />
