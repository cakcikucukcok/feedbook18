  <title>The Extraordinary Pupfish of Calaveras County - Joel Schwartz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Jeremy McGinnis, a 15-year-old in the sleepy Gold Rush town of Murphys, discovers a retired teacher spasming with an asthma attack and out of medicine, it&#39;s a no-brainer to get him to the hospital. But the local media suddenly turns Jeremy into a hero, his second &quot;fifteen minutes of fame&quot;. As he gets to know the teacher, Lester Crump, a man who has invested his life savings in three breeding Vietnamese miniature potbellied pigs and a trailer, he raises Andy Warhol&#39;s comment into an intense and engaging study of personal integrity.&lt;p&gt;
Outside of town Eliza Hewlie, a 65-year-old widow brokering the sale of an abandoned gold mine just upstream from Lester, has to contend with the threat of the deal contaminating the town&#39;s groundwater. As Jeremy and Lester design a project which becomes a huge environmental scavenger hunt, involving dozens of high school students and half their parents, the tale of a town galvanized into action is told in alternating chapters by Jeremy and Eliza. In parallel coming-of-age stories, both begin feeling frustrated and trapped at the opening of the story but free and in control of their lives at the end for the first time.
&quot;*****THE EXECUTION IS THOUROUGHLY ENTERTAINING. People are never what they are made out to be. &#39;The Extraordinary Pupfish of Calaveras County&#39; is a story with two unique view points. One follows Jeremy McGinnis, a fifteen-year-old whose reputation is overblown as a hero when he helps an old man suffering from an asthma attack. The other follows Eliza Hewlie, a sixty-five-year-old faced with a decision that could wreak havoc on the town&#39;s environment. &#39;The Extraordinary Pupfish of Calaveras County&#39; seems unusual in set up, but the execution is thoroughly entertaining, leading it to a recommendation.&quot; Midwest Book Review, Oregon, WI" />
