&lt;div id=&quot;00N40000001lfFy_ileinner&quot;&gt;This book about young colts and fillies learning to be race horses takes place on a small farm in Indiana. The farm has a half-mile training track surrounded by a woods pasture, hay fields, and various small lots used for keeping the horses outdoors. It has one main horse barn with stalls for training the horses, a second large white barn for equipment and hay, and a small shed with extra stalls. &lt;br /&gt;The farm is owned by Pops and his wife Grams. Many of the stories relate to the work Pops does with the horses. Pops has broodmares who give birth to their colts in early spring. Grams, Pops usual helper, leads the mares while he begins breaking their colts to lead, drive, and prepare for racing. &lt;br /&gt;The main character for these stories is Liz, their granddaughter, who lives on the next farm, a small distance from Pops race barn. Liz loves the horses, especially the foals. She enjoys naming them and talking to them. Liz has many adventures with Pops and writes letters to tell her cousins what is happening at the farm. &lt;br /&gt;One mare and her four fillies born over a four-year period give Pops all he can handle. Their individual habits and unusual personalities present interesting situations. Pops wanted horses with spunk, and they pour it out daily. Pops must fully concentrate to overcome their habits and train them properly. &lt;br /&gt;Liz grows up knowing happiness and excitement, as well as sadness and heartache. These young colts and the mares who mother them present all sorts of life lessons for Pops, Grams, and especially for young Liz. This book tells Lizs story as she lives near Pops farm, knowing these lively horses.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
