  <title>My Dad&#39;s Job - Deirdre Pecchioni Cummings, Erika Busse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Little Anthony&#39;s dad is a man of few words. When Anthony asks him about his job, he answers that his work is counseling children in school, but his real job is to teach Anthony how to be a man.  As Anthony grows older, this message stays with him. He often wonders just when will this training begin? Anthony is not aware until he is much older that his dad is teaching him everyday through his actions. As his father demonstrates daily how a man takes care of his family, Anthony learns how to do the same.  My Dad&#39;s Job shares a powerful message about the value of parenting with love, direction, purpose, modeling, and consistency as a boy learns how to become a man." />
