  <title>The Adventures of the First Buffarillo - Edward Loffredo, James Dishon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Easy Ed is the ringmaster of his traveling circus. After he is befriended by Cherokee Dan during a large jackalope roundup, the unlikely pair decides to drive a circus wagon train across tornado alley during the winter. But when a gust of wind suddenly knocks a wagon over, George the Gorilla escapes, meets Martha the Buffalo, and quickly falls in love. Dan and Ed do not have the heart to break up the happy couple and leave them behind for a circus show in Omaha. One year later, Bob the Buffarillo is born, and Dan and Ed meet him for the first time.
Bob is the strangest creature Dan and Ed have ever seen. Worse yet, Bob is terrified of jackalopes, and so he runs away, creating a stampede by himself, with Dan and Ed in hot pursuit. As they travel across hills, plains, and mountains, Bob leads Dan and Ed on a journey neither will soon forget.
In this charming tall tale, a young critter created from a buffalo and a gorilla finds his place in the worldwith the help of his two new friends." />
