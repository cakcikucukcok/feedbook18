  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Body of Water - Sarah Dooley</i></b> | I really enjoyed reading Sarah Dooley's well-written Body of Water. Her carefully crafted scenes immediately drew me into the story and kept me there. I felt like I was right alongside of Ember during her journey to become a young woman. I enjoyed Ms. Dooley's message of religious tolerance and learned a lot about Wicca.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: Body of Water (9780312612542): Dooley, Sarah ...</i></b> | Embers best friend The book Body of Water by Sarah Dooley is a great book about a girl named Ember. The genre of the book is realistic fiction because the events that take place in the book could happen in real life but are not based off of something that actually happened yet. Ember and her family practice Wicca.<br /><b><i>Body of Water by Sarah Dooley - Goodreads</i></b> | The NOOK Book (eBook) of the Body of Water by Sarah Dooley at Barnes &amp; Noble.
