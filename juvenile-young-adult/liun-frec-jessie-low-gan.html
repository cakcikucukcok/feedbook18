  <title>Liun Frec - Jessie Low Gan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Misty&lt;/B&gt; was on her way to becoming the leader of the greatest army of all time created by Tetris, until she discovered their nefarious plans and chose to escape and do the right thing.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;Adaeze&lt;/B&gt; was just a young African village girl and the princess of her tribe, before she met Misty and was shown that she could be more.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;Toren&lt;/B&gt; was an intelligent youth who got in trouble and left school before he joined Misty, and conceived something worth fighting for.
&lt;br&gt;Find out how &lt;B&gt;Misty&lt;/B&gt;, &lt;B&gt;Adaeze&lt;/B&gt;, and &lt;B&gt;Toren&lt;/B&gt; have to gain trust with each other and weave their way through trouble as they run from Tetris, make unexpected allies, and join forces with the mysterious Testudines. Would they get to Liun Frec in time to warn the Testudines, and succeed in stopping the imminent war against Tetris?" />
