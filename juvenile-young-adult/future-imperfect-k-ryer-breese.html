  <title>Future Imperfect - K. Ryer Breese</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ade Patience can see the future and it&#39;s destroying his life. When the seventeen-year-old Mantlo High School student knocks himself unconscious, he can see days and decades into his own future. Ade&#39;s the best of Denver&#39;s &quot;divination&quot; underground and eager to join the heralded Mantlo Diviners, a group of similarly enabled teens. Yet, unlike the Diviners, Ade Patience doesn&#39;t see the future out of curiosity or good will; Ade gives himself concussions because he&#39;s addicted to the high, the Buzz, he gets when he breaks the laws of physics. And while there have been visions he&#39;s wanted to change, Ade knows the Rule: You can&#39;t change the future, no matter how hard you try. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His memory is failing, his grades are in a death spiral, and both Ade&#39;s best friend and his shrink are begging him to stop before he kills himself. Ade knows he needs to straighten-out. Luckily, the stunning Vauxhall Rodolfo has just transferred to Mantlo and, as Ade has seen her in a vision two years previously, they&#39;re going to fall in love. It&#39;s just the motivation Ade needs to kick his habit. Only things are a bit more complicated. Vauxhall has an addiction of her own, and, after a a vision in which he sees Vauxhall&#39;s close friend, Jimmy, drown while he looks on seemingly too wasted to move, Ade realizes that he must break the one rule he&#39;s been told he can&#39;t&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair must overcome their addictions and embrace their love for each other in order to do the impossible: change the future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
