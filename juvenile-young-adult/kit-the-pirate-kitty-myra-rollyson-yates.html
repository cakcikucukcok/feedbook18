  <title>Kit the Pirate Kitty - Myra Rollyson Yates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Kit is a loveable tabby kitten who is left behind when her family sets sail from Barbados to Charleston, South Carolina, in 1699. She harbors bad feelings for the captain of &lt;i&gt;The Eldora&lt;/i&gt;. After all, he took away her beloved family, and he has a strict no-pets-allowed policy on the ship.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The only way Kit knows how to find her family again is to rally the kitties left behind and sail the seas looking for &lt;i&gt;The Eldora&lt;/i&gt; and Captain Rock. Once she locates the ship and the captain, Kit learns a valuable lesson. Sometimes circumstances and peoples actions are not always what they seem, and we shouldnt judge them before discovering the truth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Captain Rock was not the mean-hearted man Kit and her girl thought him to be. He was just heartbroken, as the two of them were. With the understanding of Captain Rocks situation, Kit and her girl made a new and loyal friend.&lt;/p&gt;" />
