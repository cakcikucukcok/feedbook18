  <title>Monster ABC - Kyle Sullivan, Derek Sullivan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Created by identical twin brothers (Kyle is the author and Derek is the illustrator), Monster ABC is a quirky, witty alphabet book that is already a regional favorite in the Pacific Northwest. Now available for the first nationally, Monster ABC is sure to find a wide audience as one of the funnier, more adorable and thoughtful alphabet books on the market.&lt;li&gt;This award-winning children&#39;s board book adds some energy and gentle irreverence to the alphabet book genre by introducing children to mythological monsters, the alphabet and silly wordplay all at once. This board book, along with the other books in the Hazy Dell Press Monster Series, is thoughtfully crafted to maximize the fun of story time for children and parents alike. And there&#39;s a lesson included as well: since monsters are made-up in our imaginations, they don&#39;t have to be scary at all. They can be as silly and nonthreatening as we want them to be.&lt;li&gt;The combination of beautiful, detailed monster illustrations and witty, tongue-in-cheek verses puts this board book far ahead of the competition. If there’s one alphabet board book on the market that parents can enjoy as much as their children, this one is it.&lt;li&gt; Popular among the surging demographic of “geek parents”, this book is a fan favorite at Comic Con events and among parents who identify as nerds – and are actively raising their kids as nerds-in-training. Including popular monsters with serious geek hipster cred (such as Chupacabra, Krampus, Sasquatch and Zombie), this book is sure to be a go-to-gift for hipster-friendly baby showers across the country.&lt;li&gt;Derek and Kyle funded the first print run of Monster ABC with a successful Kickstarter campaign&lt;li&gt; The success of Monster ABC has allowed Derek and Kyle to create four more titles in their Hazy Dell Press Monster Series, each of which take a popular monster from Monster ABC and give him or her the spotlight for their very own story. These titles include Goodnight Krampus, Get Dressed, Sasquatch!, Hush Now, Banshee!, and Don&#39;t Eat Me, Chupacabra! (¡No Me Comas, Chupacabra!).&lt;li&gt; By the illustrator of Party Croc! (Albert Whitman, 2015)&lt;li&gt; Awards and accolades for Monster ABC include: &lt;li&gt; Moonbeam Gold Award – Best Alphabet/Counting Book (1st Place)&lt;li&gt; Seattle Times ShopNW Holiday Gift Guide &lt;li&gt; GeekDad Christmas Gift Guide &lt;li&gt; PDX Parent Magazine Holiday Gift Guide &lt;li&gt; NW Kids Magazine Holiday Gift Guide &lt;li&gt; Willamette Week Holiday Shopping Guide&lt;li&gt; 30 full-color illustrations&lt;li&gt; Much longer, more robust and detailed than most children’s board books&lt;li&gt; Hefty, durable weight &lt;/ul&gt;" />
