  <title>THE KEY OF GOLD 23 Czech Folk and Fairy Tales - Anon E. Mouse, Translated and Retold by Joseph Baudis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="HEREIN you will find 23 Czech tales like THE TWELVE MONTHS, BOOTS, CLOAK, AND RING, SILLY JURA, SLEEPY JOHN, KOJATA, THE ENCHANTED PRINCESSES, NINE AT A BLOW and many more. Some of which are the Czech equivalent of perennial favourites and others will seem to be completely new and previously unread.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
THIS collection of 23 Czech folk tales is intended to exemplify the richness of spirit of the Czech race. While it may be argued that folk-tales are part of a common stock belonging to all European races, and even to many primitive peoples: these tales are all the richer, for the origins of the Czech Republic are in the ancient, central European kingdoms of Bohemia, Moravia and Czech Silesia, all of which have their unique and distinct flavour of folk and fairy tales.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
THE selection has been made from all sorts of folk tales, artistic and primitive alike; and yet two things are common to all of them: the moral tendency and a sense of humour. By this we do not mean morality in the earthy sense of retribution for evil. We mean that higher sort of morality which was the mainspring of European culture.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
IN recent times these tales have survived two world wars, the Prague Spring and fifty years of Communist (Russian) domination. During the years of communist oppression, all Warsaw Pact countries were expected to be mini-Russian states. During this time Russian language and culture dominated often to the detriment of local customs and culture. But through the power of folklore and folk tales the Czech people have been able to hold on to their national identity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SO, find a comfy chair, get yourself a hot drink and sit back and be prepared to be entertained. A warning: if you&amp;rsquo;re reading these stories to children, just when you think you&amp;rsquo;re finished, expect a tug at your sleeve and a simple request for &amp;ldquo;More please?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
