  <title>Buddy Bloom Wildflower - Jerry Snider, Karen Ross Ohlinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Buddy Bloom is a flower seed looking forward to fresh air, sunshine, and gentle rain to help him grow. After a raging stormwith help from George the Ant, Ken the Turtle, and Sadie the Butterfly, he learns the value of struggle, the joy of friendship, and the celebration of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children who love fantasy and anthropomorphic characters will enjoy the adventures and lessons of a little wildflower seed named Buddy Bloom. With courage and persistence, he meets his challenges. Good friends offer him important discoveries plus wisdom and help him find his place in the world and his reason for blooming.
Mimi Brodsky Chenfeld, author, teacher, consultant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always believed that if one can tell a great story, one earns the right to share the message. These engaging characters will teach young and old about dealing with challenges, overcoming adversity, and living with possibility. 
Jim Stovall, author, The Ultimate Gift&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this digital age, old-fashioned storytelling seems to be a dying art. Jerry Snider keeps the tradition alive with this allegory about the trials and joys that help us grow to reach our potential.
Dave Kershner, singer, songwriter, musician&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The story of Buddy Bloom captures the spirit of resilience and perseverance for young and old alike. We should all aspire to be positive in our delight in the world and how we relate to others. Well-written and insightful, this is an inspirational story that touches the hearta beautiful gift to share.
