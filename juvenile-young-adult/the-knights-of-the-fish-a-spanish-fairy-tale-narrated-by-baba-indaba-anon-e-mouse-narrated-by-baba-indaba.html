  <title>THE KNIGHTS OF THE FISH - A Spanish Fairy Tale narrated by Baba Indaba - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 411&lt;br /&gt;
In this 411th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Fairy Tale &amp;quot;The Knights of the Fish.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This Spanish fairy tale was collected by Fernan Caballaro, a pseudonym for author Cecilia Francisca Josefa B&amp;ouml;hl de Faber.&lt;br /&gt;
An industrious but poor cobbler tried to fish until he was so hungry that he thought he would hang himself if he caught nothing. He caught a beautiful fish. It told him to cook it and then give two pieces to his wife, and bury two more in the garden. He did this. His wife gave birth to twin boys, and two plants sprang up, bearing shields, in the garden.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the boys were grown, they decided to travel. At a crossroad, they parted ways. One found a city grieving, because every year a maiden had to be offered up to a dragon, and this year the lot had fallen on the princess.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? Well many things happened, some silly and some serious. To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
INCLUDES LINKS TO DOWNLOAD 8 FREE STORIES&lt;br /&gt;
