  <title>A Christmas Gift for Kanouse - C. R. Firpi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the small village of Critterville, Kanouse is a special little mouse who is different than all the rest. On his first day of school, Kanouse climbs on the bus, finds a seat, and thinks all the other mice are staring at him because he is so excited. As the bus pulls up in front of school, Kanouse notices all the fun playground equipment. He can hardly wait for recess!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kanouse pays attention and learns all morning until recess arrives, when he runs outside to play. But he discovers there is no room for him on the ball court, the swings are full, and no one wants to play with him in the sandbox! Kanouse feels sad, even after his teacher and his mother try to comfort him and tell him it is okay to be a white mouse in a gray mouse world. But it is not until many months later, when Kanouse embarks on an adventure, that he finally discovers the meaning of true friends and receives an unforgettable gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Christmas Gift for Kanouse&lt;/i&gt; is the delightful tale that relays the importance of family, friendship, and hope as a little mouse learns to accept himself just as he is.&lt;/p&gt;" />
