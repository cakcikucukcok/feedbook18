  <title>The Art of Being a Brilliant Primary Teacher - Andy Cope, Stuart Spendlow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On a good day, being a primary school teacher is the best job in the world. However, in the interests of grounding The Art of Being a Brilliant Primary Teacher in pure realism, Andy Cope and Stuart Spendlow readily acknowledge that it can also be the worst. The purpose of this book is to help you have more amazing days by inspiring and challenging you to be the best version of you because, at your best, you&#39;re flippin&#39; awesome! Andy and Stuart use their experience, studies and &#39;what if?&#39; moments combined with their &#39;don&#39;t judge us&#39; attempt at humour to bring you a fun, slightly provocative, thoughtful and motivational read. This book isn&#39;t riddled with lectures and theories from old professors of centuries ago. It while it may be true that teaching was easier in the ‘good old days’ we reckon those days are long gone so our focus is on the here and now of teaching. These new days require some refined thinking and this book is simply designed to help you to be a brilliant primary school teacher whatever the weather (including wet playtime). Embrace the power of positive psychology, lift your happiness levels, discover tips and tricks to enhance your practice and get ready for some seriously brilliant primary teaching with this innovative, practical and positive guide. Andy and Stuart tell it like it is, without preaching. This is their light-hearted, thought-provoking take on modern primary teaching. For all primary teachers - from newly qualified teachers to senior leadership team members - who want to become, quite simply, brilliant." />
