  <title>Crafting Culturally Efficacious Teacher Preparation and Pedagogies - Belinda Bustos Flores, Lorena Claeys, Conra D. Gist</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Crafting Culturally Efficacious Pedagogies and Practices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is based on cultural efficaciousness derived from the work of the nationally recognized Academy for Teacher Excellence at The University of Texas at San Antonio. The book is grounded in a research-based model, situated within the needs of the school-local community, and based on collaborative partnerships. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the under-representation of ethnic/racial minority teachers, to accomplish social justice, all teachers must become culturally efficacious. In this book, authors provide an overview of the culturally efficacious evolution model used to anchor teacher preparation and present the culturally efficacious observation protocol as a tool to assess teachers&amp;rsquo; development. The authors present four exemplar case studies of culturally efficacious teachers who have a strong identity, a positive teaching cultural efficacy, are critical reflective thinkers, and believe that they can make difference in minority students&amp;rsquo; lives. As culturally efficacious teachers, these educators are also committed to social justice and equitable education. Cross-case findings reveal that the critical teacher development model serves as a culturally sustainable pedagogy that effectively prepares teachers in the field. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
