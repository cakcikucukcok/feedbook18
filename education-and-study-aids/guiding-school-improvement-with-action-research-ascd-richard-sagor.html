  <title>Guiding School Improvement with Action Research: ASCD - Richard Sagor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Action research, explored in this book, is a seven-step process for improving teaching and learning in classrooms at all levels. Through practical examples, research tools, and easy-to-follow &quot;implementation strategies,&quot; Richard Sagor guides readers through the process from start to finish. Learn how to uncover and use the data that already exist in your classrooms and schools to answer significant questions about your individual or collective concerns and interests. Sagor covers each step in the action research process in detail: selecting a focus, clarifying theories, identifying research questions, collecting data, analyzing data, reporting results, and taking informed action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing from the experience of individual teachers, faculties, and school districts, Sagor describes how action research can enhance teachers&#39; professional standing and efficacy while helping them succeed in settings characterized by increasingly diverse student populations and an emphasis on standards-based reform. The book also demonstrates how administrators and policymakers can use action research to bolster efforts related to accreditation, teacher supervision, and job-embedded staff development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part how-to guide, part inspirational treatise, &lt;i&gt;Guiding School Improvement with Action Research&lt;/i&gt; provides advice, information, and encouragement to anyone interested in reinventing schools as learning communities and restructuring teaching as the true profession it was meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;" />
