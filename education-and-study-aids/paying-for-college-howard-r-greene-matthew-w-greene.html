      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the last 20 years, tuition has increased by a factor of more than 200 percent, which is 3 times the increase in earned income of the average family.  It takes from 25 to 30 percent of a family&#39;s yearly after tax earnings to pay for a single child&#39;s college education. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utilizing their access to college counseling, admissions, and financial aid professionals at colleges and universities across the country, this father and son team have developed a program to make paying for college manageable.  They enlighten, motivate, and encourage students and their parents to follow a set of 10 principles designed to help families get a handle on saving and financing a college education.  Their mission is to reassure and to help families of every income level and at every stage of preparation to plan a strategy for paying for college.&lt;/p&gt;" />
