  <title>Unique Primary English - Yinka A. Amuda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Unique Primary English (Level 1) is especially designed for very young pupils and new learners of English in order to reach a globally competitive standard.
This book will provide an excellent background for learners of English Language starting from the basics. It is offers an excellent focus on grammar, comprehension and vocabulary, as well as reading, speaking, and elementary writing skills.
Unique Primary English (Level 1) is complemented by a valuable CD, as well as an e-book version, both useful within our fast-growing technological world. The CD enhances the learning process, supporting the book, with an emphasis on pronunciation, diction, and fluency in reading and speaking. It is aimed at laying a proper foundation for learners to acquire quality English and build on it to an elevated standard.
The book also contains a large, varied selection of dialogue, which promotes and enhances pupils proficiency in speaking. Pupils are encouraged to act out the scenes and also to engage in interactive tasks where they sometimes compare, draw from, and use their own experiences.
Having acquired a high level of speaking, reading, and writing at an elementary level, it becomes easier to critically examine oneself and improve on the language at different levels or stages of learning.
Over six hundred coloured illustrations are featured to help visualise and stimulate learning.
The test exercises at the end of each chapter (which are also complemented by vivid coloured illustrations), recap selected elements within the chapters and are meant to evaluate the performance of learners after each module.
This unique method, regulated in all twenty chapters of the book, is meant to assist learners in the mastery of the language in a more rapid style. It is a very useful method for improving literacy.
Unique Primary English (Level 1) is aimed at contributing to the continuous development of English language at the elementary stages. It is expected to increase the learners knowledge and ability, thereby enhancing their capability in a world where English has become one of the foremost international and official languages." />
