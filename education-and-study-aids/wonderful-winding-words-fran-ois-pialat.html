      <meta name="description" content="WONDERFUL WINDING WORDS
Touring in four languages
(Chinese, English, French, German)
From Franois PIALAT
Welcome to this phrase-book in 4 languages (Chinese, English, French and German) which let us discovers fluent words and expressions from our daily life. We are at the crossing of Asian and European civilisations which intermingle with each others. Each civilisation shows its spirit according to its experience. A flow of ideas carries away the reader, awaking his perception. Funny, baffling, picturesque, echoingA colour, a fragrance, a scent beyond the words gives them their own sensibility.
The hundred words chosen by the writer during his peregrinations and recollections are enriching our knowledge on our own vocabulary and the one of our neighbours  from here and abroad. We discover an unusual Anglo-Saxon world and the Far East is bringing its exotic touch. Each word may have a special resonance in the imaginary or in the reality.
Short, a clever book to learn while amusing oneself, confirming the maxim: Truth in the Pyrenees, mistake beyond.
After having studied in Bournemouth, England, Tbingen and Bochum, Germany, the French author discovers ethnology with the hill tribes of the Golden Triangle, Thailand. His passion for Asia leads him to study Asian languages and civilisations." />
