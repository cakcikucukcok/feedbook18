  <title>CHATSWOOD CATHOLIC CEMETERY - Joan Newman Antarakis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A New South Wales native and fifth generation Australian, Joan is married with five children. Her paternal ancestors were early pioneers on the Hunter River (1826) and Clarence River (1842). A keen family historian, especially in the area of Australian history, Joan studied at the University of New England (Armidale) gaining a Diploma in Local and Applied History. Her first book, Changing Names, Changing Faces: One Hundred &amp;amp; Five Years of Catholic Life in Chatswood and Willoughby, NSW, 1895-2000 - a history of the Chatswood/Willoughby Catholic Parish, NSW was published in 2001. Her new book, Chatswood Catholic Cemetery - c. 1865 - c. 1911 is intended to be a lasting memorial to the many extraordinary settlers and pioneers who came to this area on Sydney&amp;#39;s North Shore. Over many years, the deceased and their stories captured Joan&amp;#39;s interest, especially when she discovered that several of those buried at Chatswood were convicts. There also emerged evidence of close ties to the First, Second and Third Fleets and early military regiments.&lt;/p&gt;" />
