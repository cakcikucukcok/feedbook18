  <title>The Vegan Revolution: Why And How We Are Heading Towards A New Phase In History - Joseph de la Paz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Do you want to get a deeper insight into what veganism is really about? Do you care about animals, human health or the planet? Is the future of humanity important for you?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Let&#39;s find out why veganism is the most significant phenomenon of our time and how it is changing the world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In this fascinating and surprising book, you’ll learn:&lt;br/&gt;
• The whole spectrum of reasons and benefits why more and more people are becoming interested in veganism&lt;br/&gt;
• Scientific information about health, psychology, sociology, economics, biology and ecology&lt;br/&gt;
• Why veganism is more than just a diet and also more than just a philosophy&lt;br/&gt;
• Why it’s changing our perception of public health, animal rights and ecology&lt;br/&gt;
• How veganism is spreading and getting closer to the tipping point&lt;br/&gt;
• A vision of the vegan future awaiting us&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come.” (Victor Hugo)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;“This book was born to provide words, arguments and facts that support the inner conviction that millions of vegans all over the world share: This is the way forward, and there’s no turning back.” (Joseph de la Paz)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;u&gt;READERS FEEDBACK (Spanish Edition):&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;***** Amazing:&lt;/b&gt; A book that will change the lives of many.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;***** An unmissable book, the best one I’ve read in a long time.&lt;/b&gt; Anyone who wants to understand veganism and why it’s the future of humanity will find the answers they’re looking for.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;***** I recommend it to everyone:&lt;/b&gt; It’s not just a book for vegans who are already convinced, but for non-vegans, so that they open their eyes and realise the state of the world we’re living in is in, and that we have the solution in our hands. They can’t say we didn’t warn them.&lt;br/&gt;
