  <title>A Touch of Class - Carol VanderHeyden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&quot;We always have time for the things we put first.&quot; &quot;Most people get ahead during the time that others waste.&quot; &quot;Successful people try, practice, and wander down blind alleys. They pay their dues but don&#39;t give up.&quot; These are just a few of the thousands of quotes I have collected and used to inspire and challenge hundreds of students and educators during my thirty-year, teaching, career. I have compiled these quotes along with historical quotes and documents into a comprehensive book entitiled; &lt;b&gt;A Touch of Class.&lt;/b&gt; This book is meant to be a tool and an asset to any classroom instructor. I envision this book as a resource for classroom banners and wall charts. 
&lt;p&gt; In an era of cultural changes and a need or quest for teachers to find tools to enhance character building in our young people, I believe using meaningful quotes to teach life-lessons was met with personal success in my classroom. It is my desire to inspire other teachers to use quotes as part of their daily, routine, classroom, experience. It will help alleviate behavioral problems in the classroom and aid our children&#39;s growth toward good citizenship. Many interesting, spontaneous, and enlightening discussions may follow as students share their interpretations. The art of deciphering quotes and writing interpretations is a classy way to start your day, hence the title; &lt;b&gt;A Touch of Class.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;A Touch of Class&lt;/b&gt; is divided into three sections designed for educators of all grade levels. Section 1: A Wealth of Wisdom for Teachers (Includes topics like discipline and motivation)&lt;br&gt;
Section 2: The Making of a Great Nation (Includes historical quotes and documents)&lt;br&gt;
Section 3: Earth&#39;s Wonders and Resources (Includes quotes related to scientific topics) 
&lt;p&gt;This treasure of quotes is designed to be a continuous source of strength, encouragement, joy, and enrichment through your teaching career." />
