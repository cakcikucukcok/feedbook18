  <title>The Emerging Work of Today’s Superintendent - Philip D. Lanoue, Sally J. Zepeda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This book focuses on the changing role of the superintendent who now must lead with new skills in a time when the landscape of communities is shifting necessitating the mobilization of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;people through advocacy and activism alongside new partnerships with businesses, local governmental agencies, and community organizations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;To lead districts, superintendents must ask new questions about current school structures while navigating changes in local, state, and federal education policies to ensure practices are aligned to meet the needs of all children. Key questions throughout the book help leaders create coherence in a system of change while leading the learning for members in the district and developing effective governance structures to empower leaders in making strategic decisions. Superintendents must focus efforts on leading systems to think through the world of information and digital access, so students can learn for tomorrow and to leverage social media to brand and support system-wide transformations. The frenetic work, role, and responsibilities of the superintendent requires personal and professional balance to be effective in leading districts and communities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
