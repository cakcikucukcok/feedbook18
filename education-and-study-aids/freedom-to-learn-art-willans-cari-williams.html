  <title>Freedom to Learn - Art Willans, Cari Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Disinterested students and behavioral problems are all too common in schools. Yet results show that behavior charts and other reward and punishment systems simply don&#39;t work. Teachers are burning out and students are failing. But what can be done?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The secret lies in a unique combination of behavioral science, neuropsychology, and group dynamics. When teachers get the classroom experience right, students want to succeed and achieve to their potential, while behavioral problems largely vanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For decades, it has been widely accepted that children have motivating needs including the need to avoid pain, a need for autonomy, and the need to belong. The authors harness these motivations into a method of interactions that increases cooperation, and in which children want to succeed and help others to thrive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packed with real classroom examples and practical guidance for using the methods, this guide gives teachers the tools to transform even difficult classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Start teaching for universal success in classroom management and academic accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Art Willans&lt;/strong&gt; holds Bachelor and Master of Science degrees in education and a Ph.D. in Developmental and Child Psychology.
