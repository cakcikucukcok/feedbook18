  <title>Creative Drama and Music Methods - Janet E. Rubin, Margaret Merrion</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The third edition of this popular text uses music and drama to promote learning across the curriculum and with all types of learners. Based on arts integration standards, differentiated instruction techniques, and current research, Creative Drama and Music Methods provides the theory along with applications to help teachers build confidence in using the arts in their daily lesson plans. The text is filled with hands-on activities that guide pre-service and K-8th grade teachers in understanding that integrating drama and music is easy, fun, and vital to fostering a child&#39;s desire to explore, imagine, and learn. Examples are provided in each chapter, along with the purpose of the activity and tips for instruction. Rubin and Merrion provide activities that engage elementary and middle school students and range from simple stories and rhythmic activities to story dramatization and composition. All the activities can be comfortably incorporated into the classroom routine and place no additional burdens on the teacher. They are especially useful for educators with valid learning goals but limited experience in creative drama and music. Not typical for creative drama or music texts, Creative Drama and Music Methods takes a process approach to the two arts, placing primary significance on the learner&#39;s growth and development." />
