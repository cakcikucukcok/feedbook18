  <title>Hands Up - Mikelle Bryant-Mataya</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of this book is to give others a chance to start learning more about sign language and other forms of communication. Signing is fun and I have taught my grandchildren many signs. They love signing to each other. Maybe this book will encourage us to think more about other forms of communication. I feel that signing is another language that you would like to explore. 
When thinking about how we could best communicate with everyone in our society it has definitely come to mind that we all should know at least 5 languages. We should know more than one language. Explore languages such as English, Spanish and other foreign languages. Computer languages &amp; communication media are an essential in these times of social media. Sign language and Braille are unique but very accepted and necessary for all to know and understand.
This book is intended to be fun and invite us to share our communication with all people. Just give it a chance and add to your ability to communicate with a broad range of individuals. Hands Up this book is a good starting place. God bless you in all that you endeavor." />
