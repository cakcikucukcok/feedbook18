  <title>Playing the Soprano Recorder - Lois Veenhoven Guderian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Written for general music classes, group and private instruction, and self-learners, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Playing the Soprano Recorder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; provides teachers and students with a sequential and musical approach to learning Western music notation and soprano recorder playing. In addition, each lesson provides opportunities to apply, in creative ways, the notation and concepts they learn and also to support the development of creative thinking and the tools needed for composing music in Western notation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The teaching materials and pieces presented in the text are extremely musical and satisfying to learn from the first lesson to the last. Students enjoy the richness of ensemble playing. In addition to a practice/performance music website, written piano accompaniments for all 76 pieces are included, many with optional, additional instrumental parts. The words of songs are included for nurturing both singing and instrument playing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The text can be used successfully in multiple and varied settings of teaching and learning, making collaborations between teachers in school, private, after school enrichment, and outreach programs easy. Usage is flexible; as excellent as a college text in teacher preparation and adult general music classes as in third - eighth grade classes due to the &amp;quot;go to your own pace&amp;quot; comprehensive instructional format of the book. Performance of the beautiful ensemble pieces is a natural and desired outcome of &amp;quot;players&amp;quot; learning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the selection of pieces, there are many possibilities for interdisciplinary education as well as expansions of and links to other areas within the discipline of music. All nine of the National Standards for Music Education are supported in this approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
